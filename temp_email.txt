Set up email on that domain (Google Workspace / Microsoft 365):                         founder@yourdomain.com                         support@yourdomain.com                         privacy@yourdomain.com                         optional security@yourdomain.com                                         2) One-page website that screams “real product”                                Minimum sections:                           What the app does           (adaptive training that fits life + multisport)                           How Garmin data is used           (specific: VO2max, HR, activities, training load, etc.)                           Why users benefit           (personalisation, fatigue-aware adjustments)                           Data handling &amp; privacy           (plain English + link to full policy)                           Support/contact           (domain email)                         Links in footer:             Privacy Policy          ,             Terms          ,             Data deletion request           (even a simple form/email)                                Garmin’s own Health API page frames the offering as a serious health/enterprise integration; your landing page should match that maturity.                                           3) Privacy policy + security posture (don’t overcomplicate)                                Have:                         What you collect                         Why you collect it                         Where it’s stored (cloud provider if you know; if not, say “secure cloud infrastructure”)                         Data retention + deletion                         Sharing (ideally “none except processors”)                         Contact email                       Garmin’s developer agreement references “minimum security requirements” and expectations around end-user data handling—so don’t be vague.                                           4) A tight “API request narrative”                                Be explicit about:                         Which APIs you want:             Health API / Activity API / Training API           etc.                           Exactly which data fields you need (and which you             don’t          )                         Your user: endurance runners / HYROX / triathletes                         Your business intent: consumer coaching app (beta), not scraping/redistributing data                         Your compliance: user consent, revoke access, deletion request, no selling data                                                    Reality check on “real-time”                                If your goal is             live pace guidance during workouts          , don’t tie your core MVP to Garmin approval:                         Use             phone GPS           for live pace now (works immediately).                         Use Garmin APIs later for             syncing history/metrics           (VO2, HR, load, sleep, activities)—those are typically not instant-real-time anyway.                                                      Claude-ready email you can send (to Garmin / partner team)                                Hi Garmin Connect Developer Program Team,                                I’m building an adaptive endurance training app that personalizes plans for running (and later HYROX/triathlon) using a combination of Garmin metrics and user feedback (RPE). The core value is that training adapts to the athlete’s real life and multisport load—e.g., if a user plays football/padel, the running plan adjusts to avoid excessive training stress while still progressing toward the target event.

We intend to ingest Garmin data via OAuth with explicit user consent, and use it to:                         Estimate fitness baselines (VO2max, HR trends, training load proxies)                         Monitor training adherence and recovery signals                         Adjust future workouts and weekly volume based on observed response + RPE                                Data we intend to use (high level)                         Activities/workouts (running sessions and summary metrics)                         Heart rate metrics (resting HR, HR during activities where available)                         Daily health metrics relevant to recovery (sleep, stress/body battery where available)                         Training load-style signals (aerobic/anaerobic load where exposed)                                What we will NOT do                         We will not sell user data or share it with third parties for advertising.                         We will not redistribute raw Garmin data externally.                         We will not attempt to access data without explicit user authorization.

We store only the minimum data required to deliver coaching and adaptation features.                                 Stage / timeline                     We are currently in a private beta and are preparing for a broader pilot. We’d be grateful for any guidance on the best Garmin program/API pathway to support our use case, and what additional requirements you need from us to proceed to production access.
