Target Heart Rate Formulas for Different Runners and Workouts

Overview: Key Heart Rate Calculation Methods

Training intensity zones can be defined using several heart-rate based formulas. The most common methods involve percentages of: (1) maximal heart rate (MHR), (2) heart rate reserve (HRR), or (3) lactate threshold heart rate (LTHR) . Each method has its pros and cons, and different runners may prefer one over the others. Below we outline each approach and what research says about them, before applying them to various workout types.

% of Maximum Heart Rate (MHR)

This classic method sets target heart rates as a percentage of your maximum heart rate. It is intuitive – using your total capacity (maximal beats per minute) as the reference . Formulas to estimate MHR include the well-known 220 − age (and other variants like 208 − 0.7×age for men, 201 − 0.63×age for women, etc.) . For example, a 40-year-old would have an estimated MHR ≈ 180 bpm using 220−age.
		Pros: Very simple; no special testing required beyond knowing your age. Many fitness charts and devices default to five zones based on fixed %MHR ranges (e.g. Zone 1 = 50–60%, Zone 2 = 60–70%, etc.). It’s easy for beginners to grasp.
		Cons: Inaccuracy for individuals. The 220−age formula was derived from population averages and was “never meant for the general population”, and studies show it often overestimates MHR in young people and underestimates in older adults . Individual factors (genetics, fitness, medication, etc.) can make your true max differ by 10–20 beats or more from the formula . For instance, one athlete’s measured max was 183 bpm despite formula predictions of ~170 bpm . An erroneous MHR will skew all your target zones. For this reason, experts “discourage using this method” without validation . A refined equation like the Gellish formula (MHR ≈ 207 − 0.7×age) is somewhat more accurate , but still only an estimate. Ultimately, the best measure is a tested MHR – either via a lab stress test or a field test (e.g. finishing a hard ramp run or hill sprint where heart rate plateaus at a clear maximum). Without testing, use age-based MHR with caution.

Heart Rate Reserve (Karvonen Formula)

The Karvonen formula uses your heart rate reserve (HRR) to calculate target zones, accounting for individual resting heart rate. HRR is defined as MHR − RHR , the range of heartbeats your heart can span from rest to max. The target heart rate (THR) is then given by:

THR = RHR + (% intensity × HRR) .

For example, if your measured MHR = 180 and resting HR = 50, then HRR = 130 bpm. To train at 70% intensity, Target HR = 50 + 0.70×130 ≈ 141 bpm .
		Pros: Accounts for fitness differences via RHR. Two runners with the same 180 MHR but one very fit (RHR 40) and one less fit (RHR 80) shouldn’t have identical zones. The HRR method adjusts for this: “two people with MHR 180, but RHR 40 vs 85, almost certainly won’t require the same training zone values” . By incorporating RHR, intensities align better with one’s cardiac capacity. Many coaches consider HRR-based zones more personalized than straight %MHR . When a runner becomes fitter (RHR drops), the formula automatically raises the target HR for a given intensity, reflecting improved capacity. This method often “feels right” for experienced athletes, allowing slightly higher beats in easy zone so they don’t have to slow to a walk .
		Cons: Requires measuring both MHR and RHR accurately. If your MHR is just guessed from age (and off by a lot), HRR method won’t fix that fundamental error. There is also less consensus on the exact %HRR ranges for zones – different sources use different breakpoints , which can be confusing. A potential pitfall is for novice runners or those with very high RHR: Karvonen can yield surprisingly high targets at lower intensities, possibly too taxing for beginners. Research and coaches often caution newbies against jumping straight into Karvonen zones until they have a lower RHR from training adaptations . For example, an unfit person with RHR 80 might get a “50% HRR” target around 130 bpm, which for them could be a moderate-hard effort rather than truly easy. Thus, beginners might find HRR-based Zone 1/2 a bit high, and should verify with perceived effort (it should still feel easy). In short, HRR is excellent for those with established fitness and known max HR, but raw beginners may want to be conservative or stick to perceived exertion until they gather more data.

Lactate Threshold Heart Rate (LTHR)

Lactate Threshold HR is the heart rate at your maximal sustainable aerobic effort, roughly the effort you could hold for about an hour (for trained runners, this is near the pace of a 10K to half-marathon race). Instead of anchoring zones to a theoretical max, this method anchors them to a physiological marker – your threshold point where lactate accumulation sharply increases. Legendary coach Joe Friel popularized a field test for LTHR: run a 30-minute time trial at maximal sustainable effort, and take your average HR over the final 20 minutes . That number approximates your LTHR (it’s essentially your steady-state high-intensity HR). Once you have LTHR, training zones are defined as percentages of this value (with Friel’s classic zones being: Z1 < 81% LTHR, Z2 = 81–89%, Z3 = 90–93%, Z4 = 94–99%, Z5 ≥ 100% of LTHR) . For example, if LTHR = 170 bpm, Zone4 (threshold training zone) would be ~160–168 bpm (95–99% of 170) and anything above 170 is Zone5.
		Pros: Tied to your actual performance capacity. Using threshold accounts for individual variations in physiology better than %MHR does, since athletes differ widely in what fraction of their max they can sustain for an hour. Research indicates most endurance athletes hit lactate threshold around 78–85% of MHR, while elite athletes might reach 88–90% of MHR at threshold . A generic %MHR zone can’t capture that difference, but an LTHR test does – it finds your personal benchmark. Training by LTHR tends to correspond well with training by blood lactate levels or ventilatory thresholds in lab tests. In fact, coaches often use threshold-based zones in serious training plans because it narrows the individual variance. This method is considered one of the most repeatable and accurate ways to set zones without a lab . Another benefit: threshold (and the zones derived from it) will automatically reflect improvements in fitness. If your threshold pace/HR increases with training, your zones shift upward – a good sign.
		Cons: Requires a hard time-trial or race effort to determine, which can be difficult or intimidating for novice runners. It’s not something you can get from a simple equation – you must measure it. While field tests are reasonably accurate, they’re not perfect: factors like heat, fatigue, or poor pacing can give slightly off results. It’s wise to repeat the test periodically. As Friel notes, think of finding LTHR as an “art that is useful in understanding your body, rather than a perfect answer like high-school algebra” . Additionally, threshold heart rate is sport-specific (your cycling LTHR might differ from running LTHR), and it changes with training and age . This means regular updates are needed; what was threshold last season might be higher or lower now. Finally, interpretation varies: different coaches set zone cutoffs slightly differently around LT (e.g. some might call “threshold zone” strictly 95–100% LTHR, others might include a small zone above it for supra-threshold efforts) . Despite these nuances, threshold-based training is highly effective when done right – it directly targets the individual’s metabolic landmarks.

“180−Age” and Other Simple Formulas (Aerobic Threshold)

Another formula you may encounter is Dr. Phil Maffetone’s “180 minus age” method for aerobic training. This is essentially a shortcut to estimate your aerobic threshold (the top of Zone 2, or LT1 – the point where running intensity shifts from very easy to moderate). The rule: Max Aerobic HR = 180 − your age, then adjust ±5 bpm for certain factors (e.g. subtract 5 if you’re unfit or recovering from injury, add 5 if you have been training consistently for 2+ years without issues, etc.) . The result is a target HR (really, a ceiling not to exceed) for most of your easy runs. For example, a healthy 30-year-old recreational runner might have an aerobic training zone of ~140–150 bpm via this formula .
		Pros: Extremely simple and practical for novice runners or those focusing on building aerobic base. It doesn’t require knowing MHR or doing a stressful test – just age (and honest self-assessment of training status). Many find that 180−age gives a reasonable easy-run intensity that prevents them from running too hard on recovery days. It essentially caps your easy pace to ensure you’re truly in a fat-burning, low-lactate zone. Some anecdotal reports and coaches suggest it correlates roughly with the first ventilatory threshold or fat-max intensity for a lot of people. The formula yields a narrow 10-beat zone which is easy to remember , and it can be motivating as you see your pace at that HR improve over time (a staple of Maffetone’s method is the MAF test: running at your max aerobic HR and tracking pace improvements).
		Cons: Still an estimate, not individualized by direct measurement. As the Outside magazine humorously put it, “180 minus age is generally useful, but can be actively useless for individuals” – particularly well-trained older athletes whose true aerobic threshold is much higher than what the formula predicts . In one example, an athlete’s formula-based cap was 145 bpm, but lab tests showed his real aerobic threshold was ~152 bpm . If he only ran under 145, he’d be training too slowly to optimize fitness. On the flip side, for some beginners the formula might be too high. No formula can account for personal variations in genetics, health, or medication that affect HR. Maffetone’s formula also doesn’t consider your max heart rate or threshold directly – it’s a one-size-fits-most heuristic. It should not be used as a substitute for lab testing when precision is needed . In practice, treat 180−age as a rough guide to avoid overtraining on easy days; don’t follow it slavishly if it clearly conflicts with how you feel.

Bottom line: All these methods can be viable for guiding training, especially when used with some self-awareness. There is no single “perfect” formula – even heart rate training itself has day-to-day variability and limitations . As one coach noted, the body operates on a continuum, not discrete zones, and “no system can claim absolute accuracy on any given day… consistency and periodic testing” are more important . Next, we’ll see how to apply these heart rate zones to different types of runs, and how a novice vs. elite runner might differ in targets.

Runner Experience Level: Novice vs. Elite Heart Rates

Runner fitness level affects heart rate training in a few key ways. One major difference is the percentage of max heart rate that corresponds to their thresholds. Less trained individuals typically hit their lactate threshold at a lower % of MHR, whereas elites can sustain a much higher fraction of their max. For example, elite endurance runners often have LTHR around 88–90% of MHR, while recreational runners might hit threshold at ~78–85% MHR . This means an elite with a 200 MHR could cruise at 180 bpm without redlining, whereas a newer runner with 200 MHR might reach labored breathing around 160 bpm.

Resting heart rate also tends to be lower in well-trained athletes, giving them a larger heart rate reserve. A novice might have RHR 70–80 bpm, while an elite might be 40 bpm or less. This magnifies the gap: the novice’s heart rate climbs more rapidly with smaller exertion, whereas an elite’s heart has more “buffer.” As a result, target zones expressed as %HRR will adjust for this difference (novices with high RHR will get relatively lower target zones in absolute bpm). For example, at 50% of HRR, a novice (MHR 180, RHR 80) gets ~130 bpm, while an equally maxed but fitter runner (MHR 180, RHR 40) gets ~110 bpm – appropriate, since the novice likely reaches moderate effort by 130 bpm, while the fit runner is still very easy at 110 bpm.

In practice, novice runners should err on the lower end of intensity ranges until they build a base. They may rely more on perceived effort initially (ensuring easy runs truly feel easy) and use HR as a gentle guide. As fitness improves (resting HR drops, threshold rises), they can fine-tune with HR formulas more confidently. More advanced runners, on the other hand, often train with narrower zones near their threshold and have the experience to sustain high intensities when needed. They might do regular time trials to update LTHR or even lactate tests for precision.

To illustrate, consider two runners with identical age and MHR but different fitness:
		Novice Runner: MHR ~180, RHR 75. Suppose their LTHR (estimated) is ~150 bpm (about 83% MHR). This runner’s Zone 2 (moderate) might top out around 135–140 bpm. An easy run for them might be 120 bpm (which could be 65% MHR). Pushing to 160+ bpm would quickly feel very hard (near their 150 bpm threshold). They should target the lower HR ranges for each workout type (e.g. if an interval calls for 90–95% MHR, they’d aim for ~162 bpm, the lower end, to avoid overstressing).
		Elite Runner: MHR ~180, RHR 40. Their LTHR might be ~162 bpm (90% MHR) thanks to years of training. This runner can stay under 140 bpm even at a brisk pace (because 140 is under 85% of their LTHR). In fact, for someone with LTHR 162, running at 140 bpm is firmly an easy effort. (As an example, an athlete with LTHR 160 needs to cap easy runs ~140 bpm, whereas an athlete with LTHR 180 can run up to 157 bpm and still be “easy” ). The elite can handle upper-end intensity: 90% MHR for them is ~162 bpm, which is just threshold; they might even do intervals pushing 170+ bpm (95%+ MHR) for short bursts. Their training zones will be shifted higher in absolute terms, though relative to threshold they follow similar percentages.

Key takeaway: We define workouts by zones or % of threshold/max – those percentages apply to any runner, but the actual bpm number will naturally be higher for a fitter athlete. Novices should start at the low end of the recommended HR range for a workout, and use shorter durations, while elites can use the high end and longer durations. As fitness improves, a given HR will feel easier (e.g. what was once a “hard” 160 bpm tempo for a beginner might become a lower Zone 2 number after a year of training and a higher new threshold).

Lastly, heart rate monitoring technology matters for all levels. A chest-strap HR monitor is recommended for reliable data, as wrist-based sensors on smartwatches can be hit-or-miss . If a runner doesn’t have an HR monitor or finds the data erratic, it’s better to train by pace or RPE (rating of perceived exertion) than to obsess over faulty HR readings. Heart rate is a useful tool, but not the only metric – and it should always be interpreted in context (heat, stress, dehydration can all raise HR on a given day). Now, with these caveats in mind, we can map the target heart rate zones to each workout type listed.

Target Heart Rate by Workout Type

Below are common run workout categories (with their approximate RPE from the prompt) and the corresponding target heart rate intensity. We provide guidelines in terms of % of Lactate Threshold HR (LTHR) as well as rough equivalents in % of Max HR, noting differences for novice vs. advanced runners when relevant. Remember that these ranges are approximate – individual calibration is key, and RPE should always align with the heart rate (if your monitor says you’re in “easy” zone but it feels hard, trust your body or double-check your max/threshold assumptions).
		Easy Runs (Recovery/Foundation Miles, RPE 3): This should be a Zone 1 effort – truly easy, primarily aerobic, and conversational. Target < 80% of LTHR for easy runs . In practice, that often corresponds to about 60–70% of MHR for most runners (maybe 65% for a novice, up to 70% for an elite who has a higher aerobic base). For example, a runner with LTHR 160 would keep easy days under ~128 bpm (0.8×160), while one with LTHR 180 could go up to ~144 bpm and still be in zone1-zone2. If using HRR, this is roughly 50–60% of HRR. The idea is that heart rate stays low enough that you’re burning primarily fat, breathing easily, and could run like this for a very long time . It’s better to err low than high on easy days. If you lack a monitor, this is an intensity where you can talk in full sentences and your breathing is very relaxed.
		Long Runs (Steady Long Distance, RPE 5): Long runs are typically done in the upper Zone 2 for most of the duration – a steady aerobic effort, a bit more challenging than recovery pace but still predominantly easy/moderate. Aim for roughly 80–88% of LTHR as a target band . In terms of max HR, this might be around 70–75% of MHR for novice runners, and 75–80% of MHR for fitter runners who can sustain more intensity for longer. For instance, if LTHR = 170, zone2 goes up to ~150 bpm (88%), which might be about 75% MHR for a recreational runner. At this effort, you should be able to speak in short sentences; it’s comfortable but not trivial. Heart rate may drift upward toward the high end of zone2 on very long runs (cardiac drift), so staying in the lower end early on is wise. The long run is about time on feet, not speed, so keeping HR controlled (well below threshold) ensures you build endurance without overtraining.
		Threshold / Tempo Runs (Lactate Threshold Work, RPE 7–8): This corresponds to Zone 4, targeting your lactate threshold intensity. The goal is to hold a “comfortably hard” pace for sustained periods (e.g. 20-40 minutes continuous, or intervals like 2×15 min) that stress your aerobic capacity. The target HR is about 95–100% of LTHR . In other words, you want to be right around your known threshold heart rate. By definition this will be a hard effort you could only maintain for ~1 hour in race conditions . For those using max HR, this usually falls around 85–90% of MHR for recreational runners and 90–92%+ of MHR for elites . (If you recall, elites can sustain ~90% MHR at threshold, whereas a less fit runner might hit threshold at 85% MHR). For example, a novice with MHR 190 might find threshold work around 160–165 bpm, while an elite with MHR 190 could be at 170+ bpm. In any case, it should feel hard but controlled – you’re breathing deeply but rhythmically (can maybe say a short phrase occasionally, not full conversation). If during a 20-min tempo your HR creeps above your LTHR, you’re effectively above threshold – at that point, ease off slightly or know you’re doing a bit more than a true tempo. Training at this HR improves your lactate clearance and raises that threshold over time, which is a strong predictor of performance .
		VO₂ Max Intervals (Max Aerobic Intervals, RPE 9): These are Zone 5 efforts – very intense intervals typically lasting 2–5 minutes each, designed to improve your aerobic power (VO₂ max). Here, heart rate will approach the upper limit. The general target is ≥ 100% of LTHR, i.e. above threshold zone . In practice, by the end of a VO₂ interval your HR might be 90–100% of MHR (near maximal). For example, if your MHR is 185, these intervals might push you into the 170s bpm. Don’t be alarmed if the heart rate doesn’t hit the absolute max number – due to the lag, you often reach 95% MHR in a 3-minute repeat and that’s sufficient. The key is that these efforts feel very hard (breathing is labored, talking is not possible) and HR remains close to red-line during the interval and recovers during rest. Novice runners should be cautious with true VO₂ max work; it’s usually introduced after building base fitness. Also, a novice’s HR might spike quickly and recover slowly, so longer rests or fewer reps may be needed initially. Quality over quantity is important: each interval should reach near-max HR by the last 30s or so to properly stress VO₂ max. This type of workout is typically reserved for intermediate to advanced runners and only constitutes a small fraction of training (to avoid burnout).
		Race Pace Work (Specific Race-Pace Efforts, RPE ~8): This category depends on the race distance in question. The prompt lists RPE 8, which is a high but sub-max effort – likely referring to 10K to half-marathon pace training (since marathon pace is broken out separately). A 10K race is usually run near lactate threshold or slightly above it, while a half-marathon is just below threshold. So “race pace” workouts here will hover around Zone 3–4 boundary for longer races, or mid Zone 4 for a 10K. In HR terms, target about 90–95% of LTHR for half-marathon pace work, and 100% LTHR (threshold) for 10K pace work. For example, a half-marathon pace tempo might have you at ~88–90% MHR (if well-trained), whereas 10K pace intervals could be ~92–94% MHR. Essentially this overlaps with threshold training, but might be structured as longer intervals with short recoveries (for 10K pace) or sustained tempo blocks (for half-marathon pace). The effort is hard but not all-out; you’re simulating the sustained strain of race conditions. Elites running a half-marathon might hold ~90% MHR for ~60 minutes, which is their threshold. Recreational runners might be closer to 85–88% MHR in a half-marathon (since it takes them longer, they can’t hold true threshold the whole way). Coaches often use heart rate guidance in marathon or half-marathon prep to ensure athletes don’t exceed their appropriate race intensity in training. If you know your target race HR from past experience or a recent test, those are the numbers to hit in these workouts. Otherwise, using your LTHR or %MHR zones as above will put you in the right ballpark.
		Marathon Pace (Sustained MP blocks, RPE ~7): Marathon pace is a more moderate intensity than threshold – it’s typically in Zone 3 (tempo/endurance zone), because it must be sustained for 2.5 to 5+ hours. For many runners, marathon HR averages around 80–85% of MHR (which often comes out near 88–92% of LTHR for trained individuals). To put it another way, marathon pace is about 10–20 beats per minute lower than lactate threshold HR. So the target might be, say, 85–90% of LTHR as a sustainable marathon effort range. During training runs at marathon pace, you’d aim to lock onto that heart rate after the first few miles and keep it steady. For example, if your LTHR is 170, you might find your marathon-pace HR settles around 150–155 bpm for a strong effort. Elites can hold a higher fraction of threshold (because their marathon time is shorter, ~2-2.5 hours); they might sit near 90% of LTHR in a marathon. Recreational marathoners (4+ hour finish) usually must stay around 80–85% of LTHR to avoid burning out early. When doing MP workouts (e.g. 2×5 miles at MP), heart rate gives excellent feedback – if it’s drifting above your target zone, you’re going too fast for it to be true marathon pace. Note: heart rate in an actual marathon will creep up in later miles due to fatigue and cardiac drift, even if pace stays the same. But in training, you’d focus on the early-to-mid segment HR to calibrate the effort.
		Intervals (General Speed Intervals): This is a broad category. It could refer to shorter repeats that are not necessarily VO₂ max-focused, such as 1-minute on/1-minute off fartleks, or even shorter sprints (200m repeats, hill sprints). For longer aerobic intervals (3-5 min), use the VO₂ max guidance above (95–100% MHR by the end). For short anaerobic intervals (<1 min), heart rate is a less useful gauge because it can’t rise fast enough in 30-second sprints, for example. In those cases, go by effort: RPE 9–10 for the hard parts. You might only see HR climb in the final reps or during the recovery after a very intense rep. If doing, say, 10×1 minute fast with 1 minute jogs, your heart rate will likely oscillate in Zone 4-5 during the latter half of the workout (perhaps 85–95% MHR). The purpose of such intervals guides how to use HR: if they’re meant as speed work, you focus on running form and power (heart rate data is secondary). If they’re more aerobic (like 5×3 min @ 5K pace), then you expect HR to hit high zones and you can monitor that you’re reaching ~90%+ of MHR on each rep. In any case, ensure you’re recovered enough between reps that you can hit the intended intensity on the next – for true speed intervals that might mean full rest (HR dropping back to Zone 1-2 between sprints), whereas for aerobic intervals a short active rest (letting HR drop to Zone 2-3) is fine.
		Mixed Workouts (e.g., Threshold + Hills): In a mixed session combining different elements, the target HR will vary by segment. For example, a workout might call for a 20-minute tempo run (zone4) immediately followed by 5×30-second uphill sprints (zone5). In this case, you would aim for ~95–100% LTHR during the tempo part (as above), then expect your HR to spike during the hill repeats. Hill sprints are typically all-out efforts, but due to their short duration, your heart rate might only reach threshold or a bit above on the first couple reps and maybe higher on later reps as cumulative fatigue sets in. The main thing is don’t fully recover between segments if the workout intention is to compound stimuli (sometimes coaches have you do hard hills when already tired from a tempo – expect your HR to be high). On the flip side, some mixed workouts might blend paces within one run (fartlek style), like alternating 3 minutes at threshold, 3 minutes easy, 30 seconds sprint, etc. Here, your HR will be a roller coaster: spiking into the prescribed zone for the hard parts and coming back down during the easy parts. Use your zone targets for each portion – e.g. when it’s a “threshold” portion, get into that 90–100% LTHR range; when it’s “easy jog,” drop back to zone1-2. The ability to raise and lower heart rate like this is a good training stimulus itself. Just be cautious not to overshoot the target HR in the early parts (common if you hammer too hard); it can lead to excessive fatigue before the workout is done.
		Progressive Runs (Progression Runs, finishing faster): A progressive run starts easy and gradually speeds up to a near-threshold finish. Heart rate should reflect this build-up. In a well-executed progression, you might spend the first third of the run in Zone1, the middle third in Zone2, and the final third in Zone3–4. For example, on a 60-minute progressive run, the first 20 min might be 70% LTHR (easy conversational), the next 20 min around 80–85% LTHR (steady/moderate), and the last 20 min climbing from 90% up to ~95–98% LTHR at the very end. By the finish you may reach your threshold HR or even slightly above if it ends in an extended kick. This “finishing fast” trains the body to handle increasing stress when already fatigued. Targets: Don’t force the early pace – keep HR firmly in low zones initially. Then aim to smoothly increase heart rate by ~5–10 bpm every segment. The final miles/minutes can be at marathon to half-marathon effort (85–95% MHR depending on how “progressive” you take it). RPE will change from 3 → 5 → 7+ as the run goes on, and HR should mirror that. The biggest mistake is going too hard too soon; you want a controlled rise. If you plan a progression finishing at threshold, you’d end around that 100% LTHR mark. If the progression is more gentle (ends at marathon pace), you might stop around 85–90% LTHR. This workout teaches pacing and how to run fast on tired legs – heart rate is a great monitor here to ensure the increase is gradual and you don’t accidentally spike too early.
		Hill Repeats (Hill Sprint Workout, RPE 9+ on repeats): Hill repeats are about building power and strength. They are usually short (e.g. 100–400m uphill) and quite intense (you might sprint or charge up ~30–60 seconds hills). Because of the short duration, your instantaneous heart rate is not the best indicator of effort – you will likely reach near-max HR after the repeat or toward the end of the set. The focus should be on maximum effort and good form running up the hill. Still, heart rate data can be useful to gauge recovery between repeats and overall stress. During the hill: your HR might only climb to say 85–90% MHR on the first rep, and maybe 95%+ by the last rep as fatigue accumulates. It’s common to see the highest HR of the session a minute after the final hill, as your cardiovascular system catches up. Guideline: Treat hill repeats like VO₂ max intervals in terms of intent. You want eventual HR in the 90–100% MHR zone during the work intervals, but it’s fine if it doesn’t peak every single rep. More importantly, check that your HR comes back down sufficiently between reps: for example, jog or walk until you drop to around 60–70% MHR (Zone1-2) before the next sprint, so each one can be high quality. If your heart rate is still very elevated (e.g. above 80% MHR) when you start the next rep, you might not generate the same power – unless the workout intentionally strings reps to induce high aerobic strain. Some hill workouts are structured more like long hill repeats (e.g. 3-minute uphill at 5K effort); those will definitely push HR into zone5 like any VO₂ interval. In summary, for short hills: go by effort (all-out or close), use HR mainly to ensure adequate recovery. For longer hills: aim to hit those high zones by the end of each rep (nearing 95% MHR/LTHR), similar to a track interval of equal length.

Conclusion: Using Heart Rate Intelligently

When building target heart rate guidelines for workouts, use the formulas that best fit the runner’s experience and available data:
		For runners with chest-strap monitors and some testing data: A lactate threshold-based zone system is highly effective, as it tailors intensities to the individual. You can plug in the runner’s LTHR and get precise targets for easy, tempo, interval paces, etc. backed by their physiology . Adjust as their fitness changes.
		For runners with only age and a smartwatch: Consider using a hybrid of %MHR and HRR. For example, use a modern MHR formula (like 207–0.7×age ) to estimate max, then apply Karvonen for zones if they have a known resting HR. This approach will at least account for their fitness level in setting easy vs. hard intensity . Keep the intensities conservative if they’re beginners (e.g. Zone2 might be 65–75% MHR instead of pushing higher) until they validate those numbers against how they feel.
		For those without any HR device or who prefer RPE: It’s perfectly fine to train by feel and use pace guidelines. In fact, novice runners are often advised to not get too obsessed with heart rate initially . Ensure they understand RPE cues (as given for each workout type) and perhaps use the 180−age formula as a loose ceiling for easy runs if they do have a simple HR readout . Heart rate can be an optional layer of feedback – our plan can include it for those who have the tech, but it shouldn’t be “incorporated” if it’s going to cause confusion or if the data quality is poor.

Pros and Cons Summary: Heart-rate based training is supported by extensive research and can optimize training when used properly – it helps runners avoid the common mistake of running easy days too hard, and hard days too easy, by providing objective intensity targets . Using personalized methods like HRR or LTHR improves accuracy and effectiveness of these targets. The downside is that heart rate is influenced by many factors (heat, stress, dehydration), lags behind instantaneous effort changes, and can vary day-to-day . Also, inaccurate inputs (wrong max HR, etc.) will lead to wrong zones. Therefore, the best practice is to use HR guidance as a complement to the athlete’s perceived effort and performance, not as an inflexible rule. By selecting the formula that fits the runner’s context (novice vs elite, gadget availability) and by educating them on the meaning of the zones, we can effectively incorporate target heart rates for each workout type to enhance training outcomes while keeping it individualized and science-based .

Sources: Heart rate zone methodologies and research-based recommendations were referenced from Jeff Winkler’s coaching article on HR training zones , Joe Friel’s TrainingPeaks guidelines for LTHR testing , a 2025 review on lactate threshold training , as well as expert commentary from Outside (2026) on setting HR zones and limitations of generic formulas . Additionally, Healthline’s medical review on HRR and MHR formulas provided insight into the accuracy of different equations . These informed the formulas and pros/cons discussed above, ensuring our approach aligns with the best available evidence and coaching practices.
