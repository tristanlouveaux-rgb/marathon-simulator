## Data Flow

### 1. Onboarding → State

```
User fills wizard steps (goals, background, volume, PBs, fitness data)
  → OnboardingState populated
  → initializeSimulator(onboarding)
    → computes VDOT from PBs (cv()), runner type (getRunnerType())
    → generates paces (gp()), predictions (blendPredictions())
    → builds initial s.wks[] array with phase assignments
  → SimulatorState ready → renderMainView()
```

### 2. Weekly Generation (every render)

```
render()
  → compute currentVDOT = s.v + cumulative wkGain + s.rpeAdj
  → gp(currentVDOT) → update paces
  → generateWeekWorkouts(phase, runsPerWeek, raceDistance, runnerType, ...)
    → planWeekSessions(ctx) → SessionIntent[]
    → intentToWorkout() for each intent → Workout[]
    → add commute runs, recurring activities, makeup skips
    → generateGymWorkouts() → append gym Workout[]
    → calculateWorkoutLoad() for each workout
    → applyInjuryAdaptations(workouts, injuryState)
    → recalculate loads after injury adaptations
    → assignDefaultDays(workouts)
  → apply stored mods (workoutMods, workoutMoves, adhocWorkouts)
  → render workout cards + calendar
```

### 3. Week Advance

```
user clicks "Complete Week"
  → next()
    → injury check-in (if active) → modal → evaluatePhaseTransition()
    → recovery check (computeRecoveryStatus) → adjustment modal if not green
    → benchmark prompt (if benchmark week in continuous mode)
    → compute wkGain from RPE ratings (or detraining if injured)
    → s.wks[s.w].wkGain = gain
    → s.w++ (advance week pointer)
    → saveState()
    → renderMainView() (triggers full re-render)
```

## Common Patterns

### Adding a new workout type

1. Add the type string to workout generation in `plan_engine.ts` or create a dedicated generator (see `gym.ts`)
2. `Workout.t` is a free string — no enum to update
3. Add load calculation support in `workouts/load.ts` if the type has a distinct aerobic/anaerobic profile
4. The injury engine auto-handles unknown types via `adaptWorkoutForInjury()` fallback
5. The scheduler places non-run workouts on remaining free days after runs are assigned

### `generateWeekWorkouts()` call signature

17 positional params. Called from all UI entry points:

```ts
generateWeekWorkouts(
  phase, runsPerWeek, raceDistance, runnerType,
  previousSkips, commuteConfig, injuryState, recurringActivities,
  fitnessLevel, hrProfile, easyPaceSecPerKm,
  weekIndex, totalWeeks, vdot, gymSessionsPerWeek,
  effortScore, acwrStatus
)
```

17 positional params. When `weekIndex` and `totalWeeks` are provided, uses `planWeekSessions()`. Otherwise falls back to the legacy `rules_engine.ts`.

`effortScore` (trailing RPE from `getTrailingEffortScore()`) and `acwrStatus` (from `wk.scheduledAcwrStatus`) enable the plan engine to scale workout durations (5–15% reduction) and strip quality sessions when load is high.

### State access pattern

```ts
const s = getState();           // read-only reference
const s = getMutableState();    // when you need to mutate directly
updateState({ w: s.w + 1 });   // partial update (immutable merge)
saveState();                    // persist to localStorage
```

## Subsystem Notes

### Injury System (`src/injury/engine.ts`)

Six-phase clinical progression: **acute → rehab → test_capacity → return_to_run → graduated_return → resolved**.

- Each phase generates its own weekly workout plan or adapts the normal plan
- Phase transitions are driven by pain history trends and capacity test results
- Pain ≥ 7 in any phase → regression to acute; pain ≥ 4 in test_capacity/return_to_run/graduated_return → regress one phase
- `graduated_return` (2 weeks): easy runs pass through unchanged, hard sessions get RPE-capped and distance-reduced 20%
- Detraining model: negative `wkGain` per phase (–0.15 acute to –0.03 graduated_return)
- `canProgressFromAcute()` accepts either 72 real hours OR 2+ pain history entries (one simulated week)

### Cross-Training Engine (`src/cross-training/`)

Universal load currency converts any activity to aerobic/anaerobic load + fatigue cost + run replacement credit (RRC).

**Three data tiers**: Garmin (Tier A), HR-only (Tier B), RPE-only (Tier C, with uncertainty penalty).

**Runner-type aware reduction** (`AthleteContext.runnerType`): Speed runners get volume-first candidate ordering in `buildReduceAdjustments` (easy runs cut before quality downgrades). Endurance/Balanced runners keep the default intensity-first ordering.

**Severity thresholds** (FCL relative to weekly run load):
- Light: FCL < 25% → max 1 adjustment
- Heavy: FCL 25–55% → max 2 adjustments
- Extreme: FCL ≥ 55% → max 3 adjustments

**Interleave algorithm** (`buildReplaceAdjustments`): replace pool sorted cheapest-first. Loop: replace 1 → reduce/downgrade 1 → repeat. Natural scaling: small RRC = just reduce, large = replace + reduce + replace.

**Downgrade ladder**:
```
vo2/intervals → threshold → marathon_pace → easy
hill_repeats  → threshold
race_pace     → marathon_pace
progressive   → easy (plain long run, removes fast finish)
mixed         → marathon_pace
threshold     → steady (halfway between easy and threshold, NOT true marathon pace)
```

**Key invariant**: Adjustment `workoutId` and `dayIndex` come from the generator's `w.n` and `w.dayOfWeek`. Mods must store/match original generator names (before renderer deduplication renames them).

### Cross-Training Log → Plan Apply Pipeline (`events.ts` ~L1080–1418)

```
1. User submits sport/duration/RPE form
2. events.ts builds a CrossActivity object
3. workouts = generateWeekWorkouts(...)
4. Slot matching: fill planned cross-training slots first; else full suggestion flow
5. Re-apply existing mods (prevents double-spending on already-replaced runs)
6. workoutsToPlannedRuns(workouts, paces) → PlannedRun[] for suggester
7. buildCrossTrainingPopup() → computeUniversalLoad, buildCandidates, buildReplaceAdjustments
8. showSuggestionModal() → user picks Replace & Reduce / Reduce / Keep
9. applyAdjustments() → creates modified copies of workouts
10. Store mods in wk.workoutMods[]
11. saveState() + render()
```

### GPS Tracking (`src/gps/`)

`GpsTracker` is a state machine: **idle → acquiring → tracking → paused → stopped**.

- Provider abstraction: `native-provider.ts` (Capacitor), `web-provider.ts` (browser), `mock-provider.ts` (dev)
- Points are jitter-filtered (`filterJitter()`), distances via Haversine
- Split detection: `buildSplitScheme()` parses workout descriptions (e.g. "8×400m @ 5K pace") into split targets
- Recordings persisted to localStorage with an index

### Recovery & Deload (`src/recovery/engine.ts`)

Morning check-in: sleep score + Garmin readiness + HRV status → `computeRecoveryStatus()` → green/yellow/orange/red.

- Trend escalation: 2 of 3 days low → escalate level
- Non-green triggers adjustment modal: downgrade hard workout / reduce distance / flag as easy
- Plan engine has built-in deload weeks via `isDeloadWeek()` (every 3rd–4th week by ability band)

### Gym Integration (`src/workouts/gym.ts`)

Phase-aware strength templates:
- Base: heavy compound lifts
- Build: explosive power
- Peak: maintenance
- Taper: activation only

Three ability tiers: beginner (bodyweight), novice (light weights), full (barbell). Deload weeks reduce by 1 session + lower RPE. Gym workouts never replace running sessions.

**Injury handling**: no gym in acute/rehab/test_capacity; light return session in return_to_run (level 5+).

### Wearable Activity Sync (`src/data/activitySync.ts`, `src/data/stravaSync.ts`, `src/data/appleHealthSync.ts`, `src/calculations/activity-matcher.ts`)

Fire-and-forget on boot. Two separate concerns are handled independently:

**Activity source** (what workouts were done) — `s.stravaConnected` takes priority:
- **Strava connected** (`s.stravaConnected`): `syncStravaActivities()` → `sync-strava-activities` Edge Function. Fetches activity list + full HR streams; computes iTRIMP. IDs namespaced `"strava-{id}"`. This path is used even for Garmin wearable users who have Strava.
- **Garmin-only** (`!s.stravaConnected`, `s.wearable === 'garmin'`): `syncActivities()` → `sync-activities` Edge Function (28-day lookback). Activities arrive via Garmin Health API webhook.
- **Apple Watch** (`s.wearable === 'apple'`): `syncAppleHealth()` → `@capgo/capacitor-health` → `Health.queryWorkouts()` (iOS native only; no-op on web).

**Biometric source** (VO2max, LT, HRV, sleep, resting HR) — always the wearable, independent of Strava:
- **Garmin wearable**: `syncPhysiologySnapshot(7)` → `sync-physiology-snapshot` Edge Function → merges `daily_metrics`, `sleep_summaries`, `physiology_snapshots` (all written by Garmin webhook).
- **Apple Watch**: biometrics come from `syncAppleHealth()` directly.

All activity paths produce `GarminActivityRow[]` and feed into `matchAndAutoComplete()` — identical pipeline from that point.

**Matching pipeline**:
1. Filter activities already in `wk.garminMatched` (idempotent)
2. Filter to current week's date range
3. Map Garmin activity type → app type
4. Regenerate current week workouts (same sequence as renderer) for stable IDs
5. `findMatchingWorkout()` — scores day, distance, type
6. High confidence → auto-complete with derived RPE. Medium/no match → ad-hoc workout

**RPE derivation priority**: Garmin RPE → HR zone (Karvonen) → Training Effect → activity type heuristic → planned RPE.

**Key state**: `wk.garminMatched: Record<string, string>` maps `garmin_id` → `workoutId` to prevent re-matching.

### Continuous Mode

Non-event users. 4-week block cycling: base → build → intensify → deload. Optional benchmark check-ins at block boundaries. `s.continuousMode = true`, `s.blockNumber` tracks current block.

### Scheduler (`src/workouts/scheduler.ts`)

`assignDefaultDays()` rules: long run → Sunday, quality sessions → Tue/Thu, easy runs fill remaining slots. `checkConsecutiveHardDays()` validates no back-to-back hard days. Users can override via drag-and-drop → stored in `wk.workoutMoves`.

### Renderer Workout Lifecycle (`src/ui/renderer.ts`)

**Order matters** — every `render()` call:

```
1. generateWeekWorkouts(...)           — fresh Workout[] with original names ("Easy Run")
2. Apply stored mods (wk.workoutMods)  — BEFORE rename; mods store original generator names
3. Deduplicate names                   — "Easy Run" → "Easy Run 1", "Easy Run 2"; assign w.id
4. Append adhoc workouts (wk.adhocWorkouts)
5. Append passed capacity tests
6. Apply workout moves (wk.workoutMoves) — drag-and-drop day reassignments
7. Render calendar + workout list
```

**Display states**: Planned (default) / Replaced (cyan, struck-through description) / Reduced (sky, shows before+after) / Completed (green, RPE badge) / Skipped (amber/red).

**Modification labels**: When `w.status === 'replaced'` or `'reduced'` and `w.modReason` is set, the detail card shows a human-readable banner: "Replaced by HIIT" or "Reduced — Tennis (45min)". The "Garmin: " prefix is stripped from `modReason` before display. An Undo button calls `window.openActivityReReview()`. The calendar compact card shows the activity name as "→ HIIT" appended to the workout name.

### Garmin Activity Review Pipeline (`src/ui/activity-review.ts`)

Two entry paths from `activitySync.ts`:

**Week filtering**: `processPendingCrossTraining` computes current week date range from `planStartDate + (w-1)*7` and only presents activities within that range. Prevents items from previous weeks re-appearing after re-syncs.

**Choice persistence**: integrate/log choices are saved to `wk.garminReviewChoices` on every toggle (not just on Apply). `showActivityReview` falls back to these saved choices when no explicit `savedChoices` param is provided, so choices survive page refresh.

**Auto-process** (≤2 activities, all same-day): silently slot-matches each; shows assignment toast. Overflow → `wk.unspentLoadItems` + suggestion modal.

**Manual review** (≥3 activities or any >24h old): `showActivityReview` renders a review screen grouped by date, with "Week N of T · Mon DD – Sun DD" header. On Apply:

```
integrateCount >= 2?
  → showMatchingScreen(overlay, ...)    — tap-to-assign UI
  → user confirms
  → applyReview(pending, updatedChoices, matchCache, onComplete, confirmedMatchings)
else
  → applyReview(pending, choices, matchCache, onComplete)
```

**Matching Screen** (`src/ui/matching-screen.ts`): full-screen tap-to-assign UI.
- Slot cards ordered Mon→Sun; show actual date ("Mon 23 Feb") from `planStartDate + dayOfWeek`.
- Activity tray sorted: runs → gym → cross/other, then chronologically. Only **unassigned** integrate items shown; log-only items hidden from tray.
- Assigned activities disappear from tray; tapping an occupied slot bumps its activity back to tray (swap).
- Bucket contents shown as chips. Tapping × on a chip returns it to the tray. Original review-screen "log" items shown as static chips (no ×); manually-sent items have ×.
- Header shows `weekLabel` ("Week 4 of 10 · Mon 17 – Sun 23 Feb") passed from `activity-review.ts`.

**`applyReview` matching order** (per activity type):
1. Runs: `confirmedMatchings` map → `matchCache` (from `findMatchingWorkout`)
2. Gym: `confirmedMatchings` → `findMatchingWorkout` on unrated gym slots
3. Sports/cross: `confirmedMatchings` → `matchCache` → closest cross slot by day-of-week proximity
4. Generic cross slots: skipped entirely when `confirmedMatchings` is provided (user made explicit choices)

**`proposeMatchings()`**: dry-run of the above without state mutation — used to pre-populate matching screen.

**Excess Load Card** (`src/ui/excess-load-card.ts`): always rendered on the Training tab. When `wk.unspentLoadItems` is empty, shows a subtle "No overflow" placeholder. When non-empty, shows amber card with aerobic/anaerobic bars, [Adjust Plan], and [Dismiss] (two-tap). **Previous-week carry-over**: at `loadState` time, any `unspentLoadItems` in `wks[w-2]` that are not already in `wks[w-1]` (by `garminId`) are moved into the current week, ensuring items not resolved before advancing a week are not silently lost.

**Key state written**: `wk.garminMatched[garminId] = workoutId`, `wk.garminActuals[workoutId] = ...`, `wk.garminReviewChoices[garminId] = 'integrate'|'log'`, workout `status`/`modReason`/`rpe` fields.

**`modReason` invariant**: all Garmin-sourced `WorkoutMod` entries always use `` `Garmin: ${activityLabel}` `` as `modReason` — this applies to all paths: `applyReview`, `autoProcessActivities`, and `triggerExcessLoadAdjustment` (excess load card "Adjust Plan"). This prefix is required by `openActivityReReview`'s cleanup filter. Old mods with `"Reduced due to strength"` / `"Downgraded from X due to gym"` formats are stripped on load by a cleanup pass in `loadState`.

**`_pendingModalActive` guard**: the module-level boolean in `activitySync.ts` prevents concurrent review screens. It is reset when `syncActivities()` fires if neither `activity-review-overlay` nor `suggestion-modal` is present in the DOM — covering the case where a prior cancelled review or orphaned suggestion modal left the flag stuck.

---

### Welcome Back / Missed Week Detection (`src/ui/welcome-back.ts`)

`detectMissedWeeks()`: compares today's date against `planStartDate + (w-1)*7 + 7` to find full weeks elapsed since the current plan week ended.

`showWelcomeBackModal(weeksGap, onComplete)`:
- Guards with `localStorage` key (one show per calendar day)
- Applies VDOT detraining: compound `~1.2%/week` for weeks 1–2, `~0.8%/week` thereafter
- 3+ week gaps → sets `wk.ph = 'base'`
- Fires before `renderMainView()` in `launchApp()`

---

### Workout Description Format (`workouts/intent_to_workout.ts`)

Multi-line for sessions with warm-up/cool-down:
```
1km warm up (5:30/km+)
5×3min @ 3:47/km (~790m), 2 min recovery between sets
1km cool down (5:30/km+)
```

Single-line for simple workouts:
```
10km (5:30/km+)
```

**Any change to description format must also update**:
- `workouts/load.ts` — duration parsing
- `workouts/parser.ts` — `parseWorkoutDescription()` for distance extraction
- `ui/renderer.ts` — calendar compact view extraction

### Workout Load Calculation (`workouts/load.ts`)

`calculateWorkoutLoad(type, description, intensityPct, easyPaceSecPerKm)`:
- Parses description: intervals with time, km distances, simple Xmin
- Multi-line: strips WU/CD lines, parses main set, adds WU/CD time at easy pace
- Total load = duration × rate-per-minute (from `LOAD_PER_MIN_BY_INTENSITY` table), split by aerobic/anaerobic profile

### HR & Efficiency Scoring (`src/calculations/heart-rate.ts`)

When a workout is rated with an average HR, `calculateEfficiencyShift()` cross-checks RPE vs HR to modulate the VDOT adjustment:

- Low RPE + Low HR → positive shift (amplifies the fitness gain signal)
- Low RPE + High HR → negative shift (dampens — cardio was working harder than it felt)
- High RPE + High HR → small negative shift (legitimate struggle, dampens slightly)
- High RPE + Low HR (intervals only) → negative shift (central fatigue signal)

The shift modulates the RPE-based `ch` value by ±10–15%. Weekly cap: ±0.3 VDOT units regardless.
