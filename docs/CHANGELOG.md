## 2026-04-08 — Apple Watch full physiology sync + wearable source abstraction

- **New: `syncAppleHealthPhysiology()`** — Reads sleep stages (deep/REM/light/awake), HRV (SDNN), resting HR, and steps from HealthKit via `@capgo/capacitor-health` `readSamples()`. Converts to `PhysiologyDayEntry[]` and stores in `s.physiologyHistory`, same shape as the Garmin pipeline. Apple Watch users now get sleep insights, readiness scores, and recovery data.
- **New: `connectedSources` state field** — Separates activity source (Strava, Garmin, Apple, phone) from physiology source (Garmin, Apple, Whoop, Oura). Legacy `s.wearable` field preserved for backwards compatibility. New accessor functions in `src/data/sources.ts`: `getActivitySource()`, `getPhysiologySource()`, `hasPhysiologySource()`, `getSyncLabel()`.
- **Fix: Apple Watch launch sync** — Previously only called `syncAppleHealth()` (activities). Now also calls `syncAppleHealthPhysiology(28)` + re-renders home view + resets normalizer. Strava+Apple Watch users get Strava for activities and HealthKit for physiology.
- **Fix: "Sync Now" button** — Apple Watch sync now includes physiology. Success message updated from "check your plan for updated activities" to "activities, sleep, and recovery updated."
- **Fix: main-view sync** — Sync button now triggers Apple physiology sync when physiology source is Apple (previously only Garmin).
- **Fix: misleading empty states** — Recovery cards in home-view and stats-view no longer say "Connect a Garmin" when an Apple Watch is already connected. Shows "No recovery data yet" with context-appropriate sync instructions.
- **Sleep score from HealthKit** — HealthKit has no native sleep score. Computed from stage breakdown: duration vs 7h target (55%), deep sleep proportion vs 17.5% ideal (25%), REM proportion vs 22.5% ideal (20%). Scale 0-100 matching Garmin range.
- **HRV SDNN→RMSSD conversion** — Apple Watch reports HRV as SDNN; our model (readiness, `rmssdToHrvStatus()`) expects RMSSD. Applied conversion factor of 1.28 (Shaffer & Ginsberg 2017, nocturnal short-term recordings, range 1.2-1.4). Ensures Apple Watch HRV values land in the same absolute range as Garmin RMSSD so thresholds and trend scoring work correctly.
- **Nap filtering** — Sleep samples ending after noon are excluded to prevent daytime naps inflating the night's sleep total.
- **Single HealthKit auth prompt** — Combined all data type requests (workouts + sleep + HRV + RHR + steps) into one `ensureAuthorization()` call, cached per session.
- **Permission check** — `checkAuthorization()` called before reading; logs denied types so we can distinguish "no data" from "permission revoked".
- **Files**: `appleHealthSync.ts`, `sources.ts` (new), `state.ts`, `main.ts`, `main-view.ts`, `account-view.ts`, `home-view.ts`, `stats-view.ts`, `wizard/steps/fitness.ts`

## 2026-04-08 — Readiness ACWR floor now tier-aware

- **Fix: mixed messages on load ratio** — The readiness hard floor used hardcoded ACWR thresholds (1.3/1.5) while the Load Ratio card used tier-adjusted thresholds from `TIER_ACWR_CONFIG`. A performance-tier athlete at 1.46× saw "Optimal" on the card but a red "primary constraint" banner from readiness. Now both use the same `safeUpper` / `safeUpper + 0.2` thresholds from the athlete's tier config.
- **Files**: `readiness.ts` (new `acwrSafeUpper` input field, tier-aware floor logic), `readiness-view.ts`, `daily-coach.ts`, `home-view.ts`, `stats-view.ts` (all thread `acwr.safeUpper` through)

## 2026-04-07 — Float workouts for half-marathon and marathon plans

- **New workout type: `float`** — Float fartlek and float long run sessions added to the plan engine. Hard reps at 10K effort with moderate "float" recovery at marathon pace instead of jogging. Trains lactate clearance under sustained load (Brooks 2009, Canova special block approach).
- **Eligibility**: Half-marathon and marathon distances, build and peak phases, intermediate+ ability. Endurance runners get higher priority (1.15x bias), speed runners lower (0.90x). Hybrid athletes qualify at intermediate level.
- **Four rotating variants**: 6x3/2, 5x4/2, 8x2/2, 4x5/3 (reps x hard min / float min). Balanced and endurance marathon runners also get a float long run variant (alternating 3km MP / 2km float).
- **Load profile**: 65% aerobic / 35% anaerobic, zone split 20% base / 50% threshold / 30% intensity. RPE 7. HR target Z3 to Z4.
- **Files**: `plan_engine.ts`, `intent_to_workout.ts`, `constants/workouts.ts`, `rules_engine.ts`, `load.ts`, `heart-rate.ts`

## 2026-04-07 — Rolling Load page: zone charts + chart fix

- **`src/ui/rolling-load-view.ts`** — Fixed 28-day line chart: increased height (120→150px), gradient fill, grid lines, fewer date labels, baseline label on right. Added two new zone chart sections:
  - **Exercise Load** (Garmin photo 5): 7-day stacked vertical bars, each day split into anaerobic (pink), high aerobic (orange), low aerobic (cyan). Y-axis scale, legend.
  - **4-Week Load Focus** (Garmin photos 1 & 7): 3 horizontal bars showing 28-day zone totals with dashed target range overlays. Diagnosis headline ("High Aer. Shortage" / "Balanced" etc.). Load-weighted zone split (TSS proportional to time in zone, not just time).
- **`src/calculations/fitness-model.ts`** — Extended `DailyLoadEntry` with `zoneLoad` (lowAerobic/highAerobic/anaerobic) and per-activity `hrZones`. `getDailyLoadHistory()` now computes load-weighted zone breakdown per day from activity HR zone data.

## 2026-04-07 — Rolling Load drill-down page

- **`src/ui/rolling-load-view.ts`** (new) — Full detail page for 7-day rolling load. 28-day sharp angular line chart (no bezier smoothing), dashed baseline at 28-day average, open circle on today. Below the chart: activity breakdown for the last 7 days with name, duration, and TSS.
- **`src/calculations/fitness-model.ts`** — New `getDailyLoadHistory()` returns 28 daily entries with per-day activity breakdown (garminActuals + adhocWorkouts).
- **`src/ui/readiness-view.ts`** — Removed explanation text from Rolling Load card. Card now taps through to the new detail page.

## 2026-04-07 — Fix: step sync was nuking HRV and Resting HR from DB

- **`supabase/functions/sync-today-steps/index.ts`** — **Data loss bug.** The upsert wrote only step columns, which caused Supabase to null out `resting_hr` and `hrv_rmssd` on the same row. Fixed: uses `update` (step columns only) with insert fallback, so webhook-written HRV/RHR data is preserved.
- **`src/ui/recovery-view.ts`** — HRV and RHR now fall back to the most recent entry with data when today's entry lacks them (e.g. before Garmin's morning sync). Sleep does NOT fall back — it's date-specific.

## 2026-04-07 — Display VO2 Max instead of VDOT

- **`src/ui/stats-view.ts`** — Fitness card, aerobic capacity bar, fitness detail chart, and metric page now show device VO2 Max (from Garmin/Strava) as the primary number. Falls back to computed VDOT labelled "(est.)" when no device data exists. Values shown as whole numbers (rounded). VDOT remains in the engine for pace calculations.
- **`src/ui/main-view.ts`** — Continuous mode fitness grid: merged VDOT + VO2 Max cells into a single "VO2 Max" cell (device value preferred, VDOT fallback).

## 2026-04-07 — Fix: max HR outlier poisoning all iTRIMP/TSS calculations

- **`supabase/functions/sync-strava-activities/index.ts`** — Both standalone and backfill modes used the all-time highest `max_hr` from any activity. A single wrist-sensor spike (e.g. 216 bpm) anchored the HRR denominator, compressing all iTRIMP values by ~34%. Fixed: now takes the **median of the top 5** activity max HRs. Should shift from 216 to ~191, increasing TSS across all activities.
- **`supabase/functions/sync-physiology-snapshot/index.ts`** — Same fix: top-5 median instead of all-time peak for the `maxHR` returned to the client.
- **Impact**: ACWR ratios unaffected (both sides scale equally). Absolute TSS numbers will be ~30-50% higher after recalibration, closer to Garmin.

## 2026-04-07 — Readiness: 7-day rolling load card

- **`src/ui/readiness-view.ts`** — Added "7-Day Rolling Load" card below Physiology on readiness detail. Shows total Signal B TSS from last 7 days, labelled High/Normal/Low relative to 28-day average. Does not affect readiness score, provides context.

## 2026-04-07 — Overreaching: rename Injury Risk to Load Ratio, add driving factor callout, hours countdown

- **`src/calculations/readiness.ts`** — Added `'Overreaching'` label when ACWR > 1.5 hard floor is active (was generic "Ease Back"). Added `hardFloor` field to `ReadinessResult` tracking which safety floor is constraining the score.
- **`src/ui/readiness-view.ts`** — Renamed "Injury Risk" card to "Load Ratio". Labels changed: Safe→Optimal, Elevated→High, High Risk→Very High. Card now shows acute/chronic TSS numbers (e.g. "7d: 320 TSS / 28d avg: 195 TSS"). Added red driving factor callout below ring when ACWR is the constraint. Fatigue decay shows hours when < 72h (e.g. "~43h") as a styled pill instead of plain "~2 days" text.
- **`src/ui/injury-risk-view.ts`** — Header renamed to "Load Ratio". Zone reference labels updated to match (Low, Optimal, High, Very High).
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`** — Pill sheet title renamed from "Load Safety (Injury Risk)" to "Load Ratio".
- **`src/ui/stats-view.ts`** — Stats card label renamed from "Injury Risk" to "Load Ratio".
- **`src/ui/freshness-view.ts`** — Replaced plain "Fatigue clears in ~2 days" text with a countdown circle (hours when < 72h, days otherwise). Circle drains as recovery progresses. Added recovery status detection: "Recovering as Expected" when resting, "Recovery Paused" when session logged today, "Recovery Delayed" when yesterday's session added significant load.
- **`src/ui/injury-risk-view.ts`** — Zone labels updated throughout: Low Load→Low, Safe→Optimal, Elevated→High, High Risk→Very High. Ring gradient colours aligned to new labels. Coaching text updated.
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`** — Safety label in pill sheet updated: Safe→Optimal, Elevated→High, High Risk→Very High.

## 2026-04-07 — Fix: timing suggestion "hard session yesterday" triggered by wrong day + tier recalibration

- **`src/cross-training/timing-check.ts`** — `dayOfWeekFromISO` returned the raw calendar diff from the plan's week start date, but the scheduler always uses 0=Monday. If `planStartDate` was not a Monday, activity days were misaligned with workout days (e.g. Monday's Alpine Skiing mapped to Tuesday's index), causing false "hard session yesterday" suggestions. Fixed by remapping the diff to the scheduler's 0=Monday convention.
- **`src/cross-training/timing-check.ts`** — Raised `SIGNAL_B_TRIGGER` from 30 to 50 TSS. 30 TSS caught light sessions (brisk walks, short easy bikes) that don't meaningfully impair next-day quality. Recalibrated tiers: 50 to 74 = 1 step down, no distance cut; 75 to 99 = 1 step + 10% shorter; 100 to 124 = 2 steps + 15%; 125+ = 2 steps + 25%. Two-step downgrades now only trigger at genuinely hard sessions (100+).
- **`src/cross-training/timing-check.ts`** — Timing check now carries over Sunday TSS from the previous week. A heavy Sunday session now correctly triggers a suggestion on Monday's quality workout.

## 2026-04-07 — Remove: load status pill from home weekly summary

- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`** — Removed the ACWR-based status pill (Load Balanced / Load Rising / Load Spike / Load Building) from the "This Week" card. The default "Load Balanced" state added visual noise without actionable info. Load details live on the strain/recovery pages.

## 2026-04-07 — Coach commentary: trained/untrained + heavy/light branching, single source of truth

- **`src/calculations/daily-coach.ts`** — Every tier in `derivePrimaryMessage` now branches on `trained` (session already logged) and `sessionHeavy` (actual TSS > 1.2x daily CTL). When trained + light: acknowledges ("Light session was the right call"). When trained + heavy on poor signals: flags it ("Hard session on poor recovery blunts adaptation"). When not yet trained: forward-looking advice as before. Added `actualTSS` to `StrainContext`. ACWR messages use natural phrasing ("Training load spiking (1.64x)") instead of jargon.
- **`src/calculations/daily-coach.ts`** — Added `deriveStrainContext(s)`: auto-computes strain context from state when none is passed. Coach-modal and readiness-view now get correct trained/heavy signals without manually building `StrainContext`.
- **`src/ui/coach-modal.ts`** — Fallback narrative now uses `coach.primaryMessage` instead of `readiness.sentence`.
- **`src/ui/readiness-view.ts`** — Removed hardcoded sentence overrides (4 branches duplicating home-view logic). Now uses `computeDailyCoach(s).primaryMessage` as single source of truth.
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`** — Passes `todaySignalBTSS` as `actualTSS` in `StrainContext`.
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`** — Populates `actualActivityLabel` from today's garminActuals `displayName` or adhoc workout name.

## 2026-04-07 — Fix: timing suggestion "hard session yesterday" triggered by wrong day

- **`src/cross-training/timing-check.ts`** — `dayOfWeekFromISO` returned the raw calendar diff from the plan's week start date, but the scheduler always uses 0=Monday. If `planStartDate` was not a Monday, activity days were misaligned with workout days (e.g. Monday's Alpine Skiing mapped to Tuesday's index), causing false "hard session yesterday" suggestions. Fixed by remapping the diff to the scheduler's 0=Monday convention.

## 2026-04-07 — Fix: readiness strain card shows "0% No Activity" for adhoc sessions

- **`src/ui/readiness-view.ts`** — When a matched activity existed on a day with no planned workout, `matchedActivityToday` made `isRestDay` false but `strainPct` was 0 (no plan to compare against), so the card showed "0% No Activity". Added `matchedActivityToday && !hasPlannedWorkout` branch mirroring home-view's adhoc logic: shows TSS value with Light/Moderate/Optimal/High label based on `adhocPct` (vs per-session average).

## 2026-04-07 — Unified primary message (replaces readiness sentence + HRV banner)

- **`src/calculations/daily-coach.ts`** — Added `primaryMessage` to `CoachState`. New `derivePrimaryMessage()` function uses full priority chain: injury/illness blockers, strain status, ACWR, combined sleep + HRV, sleep debt, recovery driving signal, recent cross-training, phase context, CTL trend, HRV elevation, and positive "go" conditions. Accepts `StrainContext` from the view layer.
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`** — Replaced separate `readinessSentence` block + `buildDailyHeadline()` function with single `computeDailyCoach(s, strainCtx).primaryMessage`. Removed ~190 lines of duplicated signal computation. HRV banner card no longer renders as a separate section.

## 2026-04-07 — Freshness scoring overhaul + fatigue decay projection

- **`src/calculations/readiness.ts`** — Freshness sub-score formula widened: daily TSB -25 maps to 0 (was -6), daily -10 maps to ~27 (was 0). Prevents -1 and -25 from scoring identically. More granular differentiation across the fatigued range.
- **`src/ui/readiness-view.ts`** — Freshness commentary rewritten with 7 tiers (was 4). Copy now reflects actual severity: "Legs may feel heavy. Easy effort recommended" at -8, "Expect sore legs" at -15. Added fatigue decay projection line: "Fatigue clears in ~N days with easy training or rest" computed from ATL decay constant.
- **`src/ui/readiness-view.ts`** — Freshness zone labels updated: Fresh, Recovering (-3), Fatigued (-8), Heavy (-15), Overloaded (-25), Overreaching (<-25).
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`** — Freshness zones and action copy updated to match readiness-view. Scale bar labels updated.
- **`src/calculations/readiness.test.ts`** — Test TSB inputs adjusted for new formula range. All 33 tests pass.

## 2026-04-07 — Injury Risk detail page

- **`src/ui/injury-risk-view.ts`** (new) — Injury Risk detail page following same design language as freshness/recovery views. Ring shows ACWR ratio + zone label. Cards: coaching text with acute/chronic TSS values, acute vs chronic horizontal gauges, 8-week ACWR bar chart with safe zone band, zone reference (tier-aware safe ceiling), "How It Works" card with science backing (Gabbett 2016, Blanch & Gabbett 2016, Hulin et al. 2014).
- **`src/ui/readiness-view.ts`** — Injury Risk card now navigates to the new injury-risk-view instead of strain-view.
- **`src/calculations/fitness-model.ts`** — Exported `computeRollingLoadRatio` for use by the injury risk detail page.

## 2026-04-07 — Strain model: zone-based display, per-session average, no "X/Y target"

- **All strain views** — Strain no longer displays as "44 / 103 target". Instead shows actual TSS + a zone label appropriate to the day type:
  - **Planned workout day**: zones relative to planned TSS (Below target / On target / Complete / Exceeded)
  - **Matched/adhoc activity day**: zones relative to per-session average, CTL / training days (Light / Moderate / Optimal / High)
  - **Rest day**: zone = good by default, overreaching if activity exceeds 50% of per-session avg
- Per-session average uses CTL divided by the number of training days in the week (not /7 which dilutes with rest days). With CTL=195 and 4 training days, per-session avg = 49 TSS.
- Rest-day overreach threshold = 50% of per-session avg (~24 TSS) instead of 33% of CTL/7 (which was 9 TSS, too sensitive).

## 2026-04-07 — Readiness card layout: hero ring + rename Recovery to Physiology

- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`** — Readiness ring is now the hero (140px, top centre). Sleep, Strain, and Physiology (renamed from Recovery) sit in a single row of three smaller rings (80px) below it. Clarifies that Readiness is the composite score and the others are contributing signals.
- "Recovery" label renamed to "Physiology" on the ring, pill, and pill sheet title to avoid confusion with Readiness.

---

## 2026-04-07 — Sleep target includes exercise load bonus

- **`src/ui/sleep-view.ts`** — "Tonight's target" now includes today's exercise load bonus on top of base + debt recovery. Displays as "+ N min from high exercise load" in the breakdown line. Load bonus was already factored into the debt calculation but was missing from the displayed target.

---

## 2026-04-07 — Intra-day step sync

- **`supabase/functions/sync-today-steps/index.ts`** — new edge function. Fetches today's Garmin epoch summaries (15-min windows), sums `steps`, upserts into `daily_metrics.steps`. Fast: single 24h window, called on launch and foreground resume.
- **`supabase/migrations/20260407_daily_metrics_steps.sql`** — adds `steps int` column to `daily_metrics`.
- **`supabase/functions/garmin-backfill/index.ts`** — now also captures `totalSteps` from dailies for historic step data.
- **`supabase/functions/sync-physiology-snapshot/index.ts`** — now selects and returns `steps` per day.
- **`src/types/state.ts`** — `PhysiologyDayEntry` gains `steps?: number`.
- **`src/data/physiologySync.ts`** — new `syncTodaySteps()` function. Updates today's entry in `s.physiologyHistory`. Steps threaded through the `syncPhysiologySnapshot` mapping.
- **`src/main.ts`** — `syncTodaySteps()` called on Garmin launch (both Strava+Garmin and Garmin-only paths). `visibilitychange` listener re-calls it on foreground resume, throttled to 5 min.
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`** — strain ring now shows today's step count below the TSS number (display only — step→TSS conversion constant not yet confirmed).

---

## 2026-04-07 — Ad-hoc activities shown on Home hero card + wizard banner fix

- **TSB seed consistency fix** — Readiness view, home view, stats view, and daily coach all used `s.ctlBaseline` as the seed for `computeSameSignalTSB`, while the freshness detail page used `s.signalBBaseline ?? s.ctlBaseline`. This caused the freshness number to differ between the readiness card (-13) and the freshness detail page (-10). All 5 call sites now use the same seed: `s.signalBBaseline ?? s.ctlBaseline ?? 0`.

- **`src/ui/wizard/renderer.ts`** — Fixed onboarding banner ("holistic picture of you") staying stuck on screen after returning to plan from Edit Plan. The `position:fixed` banner and return button were appended to `document.body` but never removed when exiting the wizard. Both exit paths now clean them up.

- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`** — Hero card now shows completed ad-hoc/matched activities on rest days. When no planned workout exists for today, checks `garminActuals` and `adhocWorkouts` for activities with today's `YYYY-MM-DD` prefix on `startTime`/`garminTimestamp` (same pattern as readiness ring's `matchedActivityToday`). Shows activity name, duration, distance, and "Done · View" instead of "Rest Day".

## 2026-04-06 — Strain: matched-activity detection + CTL-based overreach threshold

- **`home-view.ts`, `strain-view.ts`, `readiness-view.ts`** — Restored matched-activity fallback: when `generateWeekWorkouts` produces zero workouts for today but `garminActuals` has a matched activity (e.g. skiing matched to General Sport slot), the day is correctly identified as a training day with the matched workout's planned TSS as target. Previously, removing the fallback caused matched days to show as rest days.
- **`home-view.ts`, `strain-view.ts`, `readiness-view.ts`** — Rest-day overreach threshold now uses chronic daily load (`ctlBaseline / 7`, 8-week EMA) instead of this week's `avgTrainingDayTSS` (4-day sample from one week). 33% of chronic daily load is a stable, individual-specific boundary.

## 2026-04-06 — Freshness detail page + readiness card navigation

- **`src/ui/freshness-view.ts`** (new) — Freshness detail page following recovery/strain design language. Sky-blue watercolour background, blue palette. Ring shows TSB value + zone label. Cards: coaching text, 8-week TSB bar chart with per-week values and commentary, fitness vs fatigue horizontal gauges (CTL/ATL with explanation), zone reference card.
- **`src/ui/readiness-view.ts`** — All four readiness cards now have "View detail" links. Freshness → freshness-view, Injury Risk → strain-view, Strain → strain-view, Recovery → recovery-view (existing).

## 2026-04-07 — Coach insight rewrite: derived insights for all run types

- **`src/calculations/workout-insight.ts`** — Full rewrite of insight engine. All run types now share: split-half pacing story (fade/negative/even with numbers), elevation gradient as HR context, TSS vs plan comparison, HR drift tied to pacing. Type-specific rules (quality pace adherence, easy HR) are concise and only fire when they add info not on screen. Effort mismatch (easy label, hard effort) suppresses "easy run" lecturing.
- **`src/ui/activity-detail.ts`** — Elevation gain shown in stats grid when available.
- **Edge function + pipeline** — `total_elevation_gain` from Strava stored in DB, wired through `GarminActivityRow` → `GarminActual` → workout insight.

## 2026-04-06 — Strain rest-day model overhaul + week index fix

- **`src/ui/strain-view.ts`** — Fixed week index mismatch: strain detail used `weekIdxForDate` which could disagree with `s.w - 1` (home view's authoritative index). Today's date now uses `s.w - 1`, fixing "Rest day" ring when activities exist and wrong TSS in week bars.
- **`src/ui/strain-view.ts`** — Rest-day strain no longer shows "below target". Two states only: good (default) or overreaching (>33% of avgTrainingDayTSS, per Whoop/Seiler/TrainingPeaks consensus). Ring stays empty unless overreaching.
- **`src/ui/strain-view.ts`** — Future days in "This week" bars no longer show predicted TSS numbers. Ghost tracks only, no labels.
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`** — Matching rest-day strain model: ring shows "Active rest" (green) or "Overreaching" (warning) instead of computing strain % against avgTrainingDayTSS. Training-day strain unchanged (actual vs planned).

## 2026-04-06 — Rolling ACWR, TSB cliff-drop fix, wk1 dummy data cleanup

- **`src/calculations/fitness-model.ts`** — ACWR now uses a true rolling 7-day (acute) / 28-day (chronic) window over actual daily TSS via `computeRollingLoadRatio`. No weekly-bucket artifacts: a half marathon on Saturday is fully reflected on Sunday, and a partial week no longer cliff-drops the ratio. Pre-plan days filled with `signalBSeed / 7` as daily baseline. Falls back to weekly EMA when `planStartDate` is unavailable. Also fixed an off-by-one where `computeSameSignalTSB` used `currentWeek + 1`, inadvertently including the next plan week (0 actuals).
- **`src/ui/readiness-view.ts`** — TSB (Freshness) computed from completed weeks only (`s.w - 1`), avoiding partial-week "Fresh" artifacts. ACWR picks up the rolling approach automatically.
- **`src/main.ts`** — One-time cleanup: if wk1 rawTSS exceeds 800 (dummy test data), clears garminActuals/adhocWorkouts/unspentLoadItems so the EMA seed is the only baseline.

## 2026-04-06 — Review remembers slot assignments + carry-over card fix

- **`src/ui/activity-review.ts`** — `openActivityReReview` now saves previous `garminMatched` slot assignments to `_savedSlotAssignments` before undoing. `showMatchingEntryScreen` uses these to override auto-proposed pairings, so re-review opens with previous assignments intact instead of re-auto-matching. Cleaned up after apply or cancel.
- **`src/ui/plan-view.ts`** — Review button restored to call `openActivityReReview` when all items are processed. Previous attempt blocked re-review entirely; now re-review works but remembers assignments.
- **`src/ui/plan-view.ts`** — Carry-over card ("Unresolved load from last week") now filters unspentLoadItems by date, only showing items whose date falls before the current week's start. Current-week excess items no longer trigger the carry-over card.

## 2026-04-06 — Make excess/logged activities clickable in activity log

- **`src/ui/plan-view.ts`** — Adhoc activities (tagged "Excess" or "Logged") in the plan view activity log were not clickable. Added `plan-adhoc-open` click handler that builds a `fakeActual` from the adhoc workout data and opens the activity detail view, matching the existing behaviour for matched activities. Added chevron arrow indicator.

## 2026-04-06 — Fix readiness score mismatch between home and detail page

- **`src/ui/readiness-view.ts`** — Readiness detail page was not computing `strainPct`, so it showed the uncapped composite score (e.g. 74) while the home view applied the strain floor (e.g. 39 when daily load exceeded target). Added the same strain % computation so both views produce identical readiness scores.

## 2026-04-06 — Excess load overhaul: label, persistence, HR data, continuous carry-forward

- **Multi-activity label fix** (`excess-load-card.ts`, `main-view.ts`) — Modal no longer labels a ski+run mix as "798 min extra run". When `unspentLoadItems` spans multiple sports, sport normalises to `cross_training`. Summary rewritten: "Your N extra activities generated X TSS, equivalent to Y km easy running."
- **HR data instead of RPE** (`excess-load-card.ts`, `main-view.ts`) — Combined activity now looks up actual iTRIMP from `garminActuals`/`adhocWorkouts` by garminId. Previously discarded the HR data and estimated from RPE, producing "Estimated" tier badge when HR stream was available.
- **Keep Plan preserves TSS** (`excess-load-card.ts`, `main-view.ts`) — "Keep Plan" no longer clears `unspentLoadItems`. Previously clearing them removed activities from `computeWeekRawTSS`, silently dropping the week's TSS. Items now persist until the user applies reductions or the week advances.
- **Persistent plan strip** (`plan-view.ts`) — `buildAdjustWeekRow` redesigned as a slim amber strip below the day pills ("X TSS excess — to be allocated / Adjust plan"). Always visible while excess > 15 TSS.
- **Continuous carry-forward** (`fitness-model.ts`) — New `computeDecayedCarry(wks, currentWeek)` computes decayed excess from all previous weeks using `CTL_DECAY` per week. `getWeeklyExcess` now accepts optional `carriedLoad` parameter, added to the actual side. Training load no longer resets at week boundaries.
- **Carry-forward wired into all excess checks** (`plan-view.ts`, `excess-load-card.ts`, `main-view.ts`, `activity-review.ts`, `home-view.ts`) — All `getWeeklyExcess` call sites (except `persistence.ts` migration and `events.ts` week-advance which compute `carriedTSS` itself) now pass `computeDecayedCarry` so the excess strip, activity log, and adjustment modal all reflect residual load.
- **Load breakdown sheet** (`home-view.ts`) — "Carried from previous weeks: N TSS" row added between sport segments and planned target footer, visible when carry > 0.

## 2026-04-06 — Excess load: fix double-counting, label unit mismatch, and object permanence

- **`src/calculations/fitness-model.ts`** — `computeWeekTSS` and `computeWeekRawTSS` now skip `unspentLoadItems` with `reason === 'surplus_run'`. Surplus items represent the extra km on a matched run, but the full activity is already counted in `garminActuals`. Counting it again inflated the week total (e.g. 353 instead of ~270).
- **`src/ui/plan-view.ts`** — Activity log "+X excess TSS" label now computes from `getWeeklyExcess(wk, plannedSignalB)` (real TSS units) instead of `wk.unspentLoad` (aerobic-effect scores). The two metrics are on different scales, causing the label to show 274 while the header showed 43.
- **`src/ui/plan-view.ts`** — Review button no longer calls `openActivityReReview` (which undoes all matches) when all pending items are already processed. Tapping Review after completing a review now does nothing, preserving the matched state.

## 2026-04-06 — ACWR: same-signal fix for cross-training athletes (ISSUE-85)

- **`src/calculations/fitness-model.ts`** — `computeACWR` now accepts optional `signalBSeed` (7th param). When provided, both CTL and ATL are seeded and updated using Signal B (raw physiological TSS, no runSpec discount) via `computeSameSignalTSB`. Previously CTL used Signal A (runSpec-discounted) while ATL used Signal B — a mixed-signal mismatch that caused ACWR to read artificially low for cross-training athletes. New `'low'` status for `ratio < 0.8` distinguishes genuine deload from no-history `'unknown'`.
- **All 15 call sites** (`home-view.ts`, `stats-view.ts`, `readiness-view.ts`, `main-view.ts`, `events.ts`, `activity-review.ts`, `renderer.ts`, `daily-coach.ts`) — pass `s.signalBBaseline ?? undefined` as `signalBSeed`. Falls back to legacy mixed-signal when Strava history not yet synced.

## 2026-04-06 — Activity review: object permanence + surplus load for manual matches

- **`src/ui/plan-view.ts`** — Review button now calls `showActivityReview` (no undo) when there are still `__pending__` items, and only calls `openActivityReReview` (full undo/re-show) when everything is already processed. Previously always called `openActivityReReview`, which undid all decisions on every tap.
- **`src/ui/activity-review.ts`** — Manual run matching in `applyReview` now computes a surplus `UnspentLoadItem` when actual km > 30% over planned km, matching the `matchAndAutoComplete` auto-match path. Surplus flows to `wk.unspentLoad` and `wk.unspentLoadItems`. Imported `calculateWorkoutLoad` from `@/workouts/load`.

## 2026-04-06 — Activity log: show stats for Logged/Excess adhoc items

- **`src/ui/plan-view.ts`** — fixed stats display for Logged/Excess activities in the plan activity log. `garminActuals` is keyed by plan slot ID, not garminId, so the previous lookup always returned undefined for adhoc items. Stats now read directly from the fields stored by `addAdhocWorkoutFromPending` (`garminDistKm`, `garminDurationMin`, `garminAvgHR`). Pace computed from those fields when available.

## 2026-04-06 — Strain ring: fix "Rest" shown when activity matched to a different-day slot

- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`**, **`src/ui/strain-view.ts`** — when `plannedDayTSS === 0` but `garminActuals` contains a matched activity for today, fall back to computing planned TSS from the matched workout (regardless of its scheduled `dayOfWeek`). Prevents "Rest / 118 TSS" when the user did their planned run on a different calendar day than it was scheduled.
- Added `estimateWorkoutDurMin` import to `strain-view.ts`; added same to `home-view.ts`.

## 2026-04-05 — Activity log: show stats for Logged/Excess adhoc items

- **`src/ui/plan-view.ts`** — fixed stats display for Logged/Excess activities in the plan activity log. `garminActuals` is keyed by plan slot ID, not garminId, so the previous lookup always returned undefined for adhoc items. Stats now read directly from the fields stored by `addAdhocWorkoutFromPending` (`garminDistKm`, `garminDurationMin`, `garminAvgHR`). Pace computed from those fields when available.

## 2026-04-05 — Strain target: apply workoutMods in strain-view so ring matches plan card

- **`src/ui/strain-view.ts`** — both the ring target path (`computeStrainData`) and the week bars path (`buildWeekBarData`) now apply `wk.workoutMods` (distance/type/RPE changes from auto-reduce) after `workoutMoves`. Previously only day moves were applied, causing the ring to use the original workout distance while the plan card used the reduced one.
- Added `isTimingMod` import from `@/cross-training/timing-check` to mirror the plan-view mod-application logic exactly.

## 2026-04-05 — Strain target: fix planned TSS to match plan card

- **`src/calculations/fitness-model.ts`** — extracted `estimateWorkoutDurMin(w, baseMinPerKm)` from `plan-view.ts`. Handles km-based descriptions (converts via pace by workout type), interval formats, and `min`-pattern fallback. Updated `computePlannedDaySignalBTSS` to accept `baseMinPerKm` param and use `estimateWorkoutDurMin` instead of the old `parseDurMinFromDesc` 30-min fallback.
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`**, **`src/ui/strain-view.ts`** — all `computePlannedDaySignalBTSS` call sites now pass `s.pac?.e ? s.pac.e / 60 : 5.5` so the strain target matches the plan card TSS exactly.
- **`src/ui/plan-view.ts`** — `plannedTSS` now uses shared `estimateWorkoutDurMin` instead of inline duplicate logic.

## 2026-04-05 — Activity sync: ring fill on rest days + run review prompt + TSS dedup

- **`src/ui/strain-view.ts`** — rest-day ring now fills when actual TSS > 0. Reference = average planned TSS across training days this week (so 100% = "matched a typical training day load"). Previously strainPct was hard-clamped to 0 on rest days.
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`** — same fix applied to the home-view ring (same formula, same reference).
- **`src/data/activitySync.ts`** — `isBatchSync` now returns `true` when any pending item is a run, routing it to Activity Review instead of silent auto-processing.
- **`src/calculations/activity-matcher.ts`** — `matchAndAutoComplete`: added skip guard at top of row loop — activities with a final `garminMatched` entry (not `'__pending__'`) are skipped on re-sync. Prevents `wk.actualTSS` double-accumulation and duplicate adhocWorkouts.
- **`src/calculations/activity-matcher.ts`** — `addAdhocWorkout`: added dedup check matching the existing guard in `addAdhocWorkoutFromPending`.

## 2026-04-05 — Excess load modal: "Push to next week" button

- **`src/ui/suggestion-modal.ts`** — `showSuggestionModal` now accepts an optional `onPushToNextWeek` callback (6th param). When provided, renders a "Push to next week" bordered button between Reduce and Keep Plan.
- **`src/ui/excess-load-card.ts`** — `triggerExcessLoadAdjustment` passes the carryover callback so the modal shows all 3 options: Reduce (future workouts only), Push to next week, Keep Plan.

## 2026-04-05 — Sleep score: use Garmin directly, drop chronic/acute formula

- **`src/calculations/readiness.ts`** — sleep sub-score now uses Garmin's 0–100 score as-is (most recent entry in history). Removed the chronic/acute relative formula (7d avg vs 28d baseline, asymmetric acute modifier). Garmin's score is already population-normalised; the relative layer was distorting a signal the user already sees in the Garmin app.
- Two readiness tests updated to reflect the new pass-through behaviour.

## 2026-04-05 — Recovery scoring: baseline anchor 65 → 80, RHR switched to absolute bpm

- **`src/calculations/readiness.ts`** — changed the neutral anchor from 65 to 80 across all three sub-scores (HRV, sleep, RHR). "At your personal baseline" now scores 80 — reflecting that normal metrics mean ready to train, not merely adequate.
- **`src/calculations/readiness.ts`** — RHR scoring switched from percentage-based to absolute bpm deviation (Buchheit 2014): `80 − deltaBpm × 5`. At baseline → 80, −5 bpm → 100, +4 bpm → 60, +7 bpm → 45. Previous percentage formula was overshooting small deviations.
- **`src/calculations/readiness.ts`** — zone thresholds updated: Excellent ≥80, Good 65–79, Fair 45–64, Poor <45.

## 2026-04-05 — Home readiness: triangle layout + new Readiness detail page

- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`** — Readiness section redesigned to triangle layout: Readiness ring top-centre (120px, larger), Sleep + Strain rings side by side below (100px). Freshness/Injury Risk/Recovery pill row removed from home view.
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`** — Tapping the Readiness ring now opens the new `readiness-view.ts` instead of `recovery-view.ts`. Adjust button moved to below the sentence (no longer inside the pills wrapper).
- **`src/ui/readiness-view.ts`** — New detail page (sky-gradient design, same as recovery-view). Shows animated composite ring, readiness sentence, and three sub-signal cards: Freshness (TSB + zone), Injury Risk (ACWR + status), Recovery (score/100 + "View detail ›" link). Back button returns to home.

## 2026-04-04 — Recovery page: sub-scores row + honest HRV badge

- **`src/ui/recovery-view.ts`** — added sub-score row (HRV / Sleep / RHR) directly under the recovery ring so the composite is legible.
- **`src/ui/recovery-view.ts`** — HRV tile badge now reflects the chronic signal (7d avg vs 28d baseline, the same signal feeding the score): green "Normal" when score ≥ 65, amber "Slightly suppressed" when 45–64, amber "Below personal norm" when < 45. Previously showed a green tick whenever today's HRV was above the 7-day avg, which contradicted the composite score.
- **`src/ui/recovery-view.ts`** — added acute context line under the HRV badge: "Today +32% vs 7-day avg" — explains today's reading without it overriding the chronic story.

## 2026-04-04 — HRV scoring: science-based z-score method + readiness recovery floor

- **`src/calculations/readiness.ts`** — HRV score now uses a SD/z-score method (Plews/Flatt/Buchheit) when ≥ 10 baseline readings are available. `z = (7d avg − 28d avg) / 28d SD`, mapped to score via `65 + z × 20`. Fallback to the previous percentage method for the first ~10 nights of data. Added `hrvDataSufficient: boolean` to `RecoveryScoreResult`.
- **`src/calculations/readiness.ts`** — added sliding recovery floor to `computeReadiness`: `floor = 40 + (recoveryScore × 0.60)`. Prevents "Ready to Push" (≥80) when recovery is below ~67, and keeps readiness in "On Track" (≤63) when recovery is 38.
- **`src/ui/recovery-view.ts`** — HRV tile shows "Score improves after 10 nights of data" note when the z-score method is not yet active.

## 2026-04-04 — Fix: readiness composite now uses the full recovery score (HRV + sleep + RHR)

- **`src/calculations/readiness.ts`** — added `precomputedRecoveryScore` to `ReadinessInput`. When provided, it replaces the internal sleep-only formula as the recovery sub-signal. `sleepScore` is still used for the safety floor checks (sleep < 60 cap etc.).
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`** (both call sites), **`src/ui/stats-view.ts`**, **`src/calculations/daily-coach.ts`** — `computeRecoveryScore` is now called before `computeReadiness` and its result passed in. This ensures the Recovery value that influences the readiness composite is the same value shown to the user (HRV 45% + sleep 35% + RHR 20%), eliminating the contradiction where Recovery 38/100 could coexist with Readiness 91.

---

## 2026-04-03 — Fix: unmatched activities showing in strain but not in timeline

- **`src/ui/activity-review.ts`** (`autoProcessActivities`) — run and cross-training overflow items (no matching plan slot) are now logged as adhoc workouts AND `garminMatched` is set, matching the existing gym overflow behaviour. Previously they only went to `unspentLoadItems`, which meant: (1) they showed in the strain ring TSS but were invisible in the activity timeline, and (2) `garminMatched` was never set so they were re-processed on every app launch. `seenGarminIds` dedup in `computeTodaySignalBTSS` prevents double-counting when both adhoc and unspentLoadItems entries exist.

---

## 2026-04-03 — Fix: today's hero card shows real activity name when matched to Strava

- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`** (`buildTodayWorkout`) — when the plan slot is matched to a Strava/Garmin actual, the hero title now uses `formatActivityType(actual.activityType)` instead of the plan slot name (e.g. "Alpine Skiing" instead of "General Sport 2"). Planned description is suppressed when a real activity exists (it would be wrong, e.g. "90min general sport" for a ski session). Duration and distance are taken from the actual when available. "Done" pill becomes a tappable "Done · View" button that opens the activity detail page.

---

## 2026-04-03 — Feature: Today's Strain page rebuild + rest day target fix

- **`src/ui/strain-view.ts`** — rebuilt page structure. Removed 7-day mins, 7-day kCal sparkline cards, and coaching card. Added 7-day week position bars (one row per day Mon–Sun of the current plan week, actual TSS filled against planned TSS track, today in orange, future days ghost track). Added steps placeholder card ("Daily steps / — / Garmin steps coming soon"). Page title and ring label renamed from "Strain" to "Today's Strain"; ALL-CAPS `text-transform` removed from ring label. Rest day behaviour: if `computePlannedDaySignalBTSS` returns 0, ring shows "Rest day" in grey with "X TSS logged" sub-label if any activity; no % shown on rest days.
- **`src/ui/strain-view.ts` (`getStrainForDate`)** — removed baseline fallback for target TSS. Rest days (planned sessions = 0) now return `targetTSS = 0` and `isRestDay = true`. Historical date lookup now resolves the correct plan week via `weekIdxForDate` instead of always using today's week.
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`** — fixed rest-day target bug: `targetTSS` no longer falls back to `signalBBaseline ÷ 7` when `plannedDayTSS === 0` (was showing 103 TSS target on rest days). Ring content now shows "Rest day / X TSS logged" instead of "X / 103 target" when exercising on a rest day. Label above ring renamed from "Strain" to "Today's Strain".

---

## 2026-04-03 — Feature: sleep ring on home page

- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`** — added sleep ring between Readiness and Strain rings. Shows sleep score (0–100) with sleep duration below. Tapping navigates to the sleep detail page. All three rings shrunk from 120px to 100px (viewBox unchanged) to fit the 3-ring row.

---

## 2026-04-02 — Feature: leg load fatigue signal

- **`src/types/activities.ts`** — added `legLoadPerMin?: number` to `SportConfig`
- **`src/constants/sports.ts`** — populated `legLoadPerMin` for all sports across 4 tiers: vertical sports (hiking/skiing/stair_climbing = 0.50), sustained flat leg (rowing = 0.35, cycling/elliptical = 0.25), intermittent (skating/soccer/etc = 0.10–0.18), minimal (walking = 0.05). Not-leg sports (swimming, boxing, etc) have no value (0).
- **`src/types/state.ts`** — added `recentLegLoads` array to persist leg load entries with sport label and timestamp
- **`src/calculations/readiness.ts`** — added `recentLegLoads` input, 36-hour half-life exponential decay, and `legLoadNote` output. Note triggers at decayed sum >20 (moderate) or >60 (heavy).
- **`src/ui/activity-review.ts`** — `recordLegLoad()` called at both cross-training save points; stores load + sport label + timestamp in state, trimming to last 7 days
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`** — `legLoadNote` passed to `PillSheetData` and rendered in the Injury Risk pill pop-up when leg fatigue is elevated

---

## 2026-04-02 — Fix: activity matching, strain load, and strain activity list

- **`src/calculations/fitness-model.ts` (`computeTodaySignalBTSS`)** — garmin-prefixed adhoc workouts were unconditionally skipped, so log-only and unmatched activities contributed 0 to today's strain. Now filtered by `garminTimestamp` (same field `addAdhocWorkoutFromPending` writes) with garminId dedup to prevent double-counting vs `unspentLoadItems`.
- **`src/ui/strain-view.ts` (`activitiesForDate`)** — only read `garminActuals`; garmin-prefixed adhoc workouts (unmatched / log-only) were invisible to the strain view activity list. Now also iterates `adhocWorkouts`, converts them to `GarminActual` shape using the stored `garminTimestamp` / `garminDistKm` / `garminDurationMin` / `garminAvgHR` fields, with garminId dedup across both sources.
- **`src/ui/activity-review.ts` (`openActivityReReview`)** — added `weekNum` parameter (1-based); function previously always operated on the current week (`s.w - 1`). Previous-week unmatched items are now handled: the plan window has passed so they are silently logged as adhoc and cleared from the pending list without showing the full review UI. Also: `unspentLoadItems` is now cleared per-item during the undo pass (preventing stale load entries from a previous review round), included in the Cancel snapshot/restore, and restored correctly on cancel.
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`** — unmatched activity rows now carry `data-week-num`; click handler reads it and passes the correct week to `openActivityReReview` so previous-week items can be resolved. Click handler also now passes `renderHomeView` as `onDone` so the user lands back on the home view (with the items cleared) rather than the plan view after completing the review.

## 2026-04-07 — Floor-aware reductions in cross-training suggester

- **`src/cross-training/suggester.ts`** — `buildReduceAdjustments` and `buildReplaceAdjustments` now enforce a weekly running km floor. When ACWR is safe or low, distance reductions and replacements stop once total planned running hits the floor. When ACWR is caution or high, the floor is bypassed (injury prevention takes priority). Long runs get extra protection: floor keeps at least 85% of original distance. `AthleteContext` gains optional `floorKm` and `acwrStatus` fields.
- **`src/calculations/fitness-model.ts`** — Extracted `computeRunningFloorKm()` (was duplicated in events.ts). Takes marathon pace, current week, total weeks.
- **All call sites** (`events.ts`, `main-view.ts`, `activity-review.ts`, `excess-load-card.ts`, `recording-handler.ts`) now pass `floorKm` and `acwrStatus` to `buildCrossTrainingPopup`.

## 2026-04-07 — Km floor nudge redesign

- **`src/ui/plan-view.ts`** — Redesigned km floor nudge card. When cross-training reduces runs but running km is below floor, card explains the tension ("Load high, km low") and shows per-run extend buttons. User chooses which easy run to top up. Reduced runs can restore up to original; unreduced easy runs get up to 20%. Gated by ACWR safe. Button targeting uses workout name + day (not array index) for stability.
- **`src/ui/events.ts`** — `maybeInitKmNudge()` stores `{ floorKm, hasReductions }` signal. Candidates computed at render time.
- **`src/ui/main-view.ts`** — Removed home-view `stat-km-floor-nudge` (consolidated to plan view).

## 2026-04-02 — Fix: Reduce button unresponsive in suggestion modal

- **`src/ui/suggestion-modal.ts`** — `stopPropagation` was attached to all clicks inside `<details>` elements, blocking button clicks when "View changes" was expanded. Changed to only stop propagation on `<summary>` toggle clicks. Reduce (and Replace) buttons now respond correctly when the adjustment list is expanded.

## 2026-03-26 — Strain detail page (new iPhone-native design language)

- **`src/ui/strain-view.ts`** — new full-screen strain detail page. Terracotta/orange gradient header with glowing orbs, animated SVG ring (orange gradient fill), 7-day rolling stat cards (minutes + kCal with sparklines), factual rules-based coaching card, and activity timeline. Date picker shows last 7 rolling days. Info button opens a strain explainer overlay. Timeline rows open an activity detail overlay (duration, distance, HR, TSS, calories). Back button returns to Home.
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`** — added `id="home-strain-ring"` + `cursor:pointer` to the strain ring container. Wired click handler → `renderStrainView()`. Strain ring is now tappable.

## 2026-03-26 — Sleep stage analysis + sleep bank readiness floor

- **`src/calculations/sleep-insights.ts`** — added `stageQuality()`: population-norm quality labels (Excellent/Good/Low/Normal/Elevated) for Deep, REM, and Awake stages. Added `getStageInsight()`: consultant-tone insight comparing today's REM/Deep to 7-day personal average; falls back to population norms when < 3 nights of history.
- **`src/calculations/readiness.ts`** — added `sleepBankSec?: number | null` to `ReadinessInput`. Sleep bank floor: > 3h deficit caps score at 74, > 5h caps at 59.
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`** — `showSleepSheet` redesigned as a full-screen dark UI with quality labels on stage bars, REM/Deep vs 7-day insight card, and sleep bank line chart. All three `computeReadiness` call sites now pass `sleepBankSec` (requires >= 3 nights of data).
- **`src/ui/stats-view.ts`** — `computeReadiness` call now passes `sleepBankSec`.

## 2026-03-25 — Sleep bank redesign

- **`src/types/state.ts`** — added `sleepTargetSec?: number` field; user-set sleep target override.
- **`src/calculations/sleep-insights.ts`** — added `deriveSleepTarget()`: 75th percentile of last 30 nights (requires 14+), fallback 7.5h. Changed `getSleepBank()` window from 7 to 14 nights. Default target changed from 8h to 7.5h. Added `buildSleepBankLineChart()`: clean line chart with dashed zero baseline and terminal dot, replaces the flat area chart.
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`** — sleep bank now uses `s.sleepTargetSec ?? deriveSleepTarget()` as the baseline. Chart replaced with `buildSleepBankLineChart`. "vs 8h/night" label now shows the actual target (e.g. "vs 7h 30m/night"). Minimum nights to show headline raised from 1 to 3.
- **`src/ui/stats-view.ts`** — readiness computation now uses effective sleep target.
- **`src/ui/account-view.ts`** — new "Sleep target" row in Preferences. Shows current target and source (Custom / From your history / Default). Edit mode with hours and minutes inputs (15-min steps). "Use history" button clears the override and reverts to derived target.

## 2026-03-25 — Sleep history access from Recovery pill sheet

- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`** — Recovery pill sheet sleep row now navigates to sleep history even when today's Garmin sleep has not arrived yet, as long as there are past nights in `physiologyHistory`. Previously the row was completely unresponsive (and showed no pointer cursor) when `noGarminSleepToday && !manualSleepScore`. Added `hasHistoricSleep` to `PillSheetData` and threaded it from the pill click handler.

## 2026-03-25 — Strain Score fixes

- **`src/calculations/fitness-model.ts`** — added `computePlannedDaySignalBTSS(workouts, dayOfWeek)`. Estimates Signal B TSS for a day's planned workouts using RPE × TL_PER_MIN × duration (same fallback logic as `computeTodaySignalBTSS`). No runSpec discount — Signal B is full physiological load.
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts` (`buildReadinessRing`)** — strain target now uses today's planned workout TSS when the plan has sessions scheduled, falling back to `signalBBaseline ÷ 7` on rest days. Fixes the bug where a hard-day target (e.g. 120 TSS long run) was being compared against a flat daily average (~40 TSS), making readiness floor at Manage Load before the session was done.
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts` (`buildReadinessRing`)** — readiness sentence is now strain-aware. Strain ≥ 130% → "Daily load exceeded target…"; ≥ 100% → "Daily target hit. Training is complete for today."; any training → "Session logged. Rest for the remainder of the day." TSB/ACWR matrix sentence only shown when no training has occurred. Removed motivational padding from the old `trainedToday` fallback.
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`** — `trainedToday` now derived from `todaySignalBTSS > 0` (covers both garminActuals and adhocWorkouts) instead of inspecting garminActuals alone.
- **`src/calculations/readiness.ts`** — `strainPct` now destructured at the top of `computeReadiness` with all other inputs (was accessed as `input.strainPct` inconsistently).
- **`docs/strain.md`** — new design doc covering the strain model, target logic, readiness interaction, and known gaps.

---

## 2026-03-22 — Coach Brain (Phase 1)

- **`src/calculations/daily-coach.ts`** — new central aggregator. `computeDailyCoach(state)` collates all signals (TSB, ACWR, sleep, HRV, RPE, week load, injury, illness) and returns a `CoachState` with `stance`, `blockers`, `alertLevel`, and a fully structured `CoachSignals` payload ready for the LLM.
- **`supabase/functions/coach-narrative/index.ts`** — new edge function. Accepts `CoachSignals`, calls `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, returns a 2–3 sentence coaching paragraph. System prompt enforces direct/factual tone (no motivational padding, inline bold numbers, no emoji).
- **`src/ui/coach-modal.ts`** — Coach overlay with readiness ring (SVG arc, same pattern as Home ring), signal rows (freshness, load safety, sleep, HRV, week load), and LLM narrative card. Client-side rate limit: 3 calls/day with 4-hour cache in localStorage (`mosaic_coach_narrative_cache`). Cached narrative shown when limit is reached.
- **"Coach" button** added to Home header (between Check-in and account) and Plan header (current week only, before Check-in). Same pill style as Check-in.
- **`docs/BRAIN.md`** — architecture spec for the central coaching brain concept.

## 2026-03-22

- **Low readiness modal**: converted static option cards (Rest today, Reorder the week, Reduce intensity) into clickable buttons. Rest closes the modal; Reorder navigates to plan view; Reduce intensity calls `applyRecoveryAdjustment` (downgrade for hard sessions, easyflag for easy runs). Added `todayAnyWorkout` detection so the reduce action works even when no hard session is scheduled.

## 2026-03-22 — Daily Headline Narrative (Bevel-inspired)

- **`buildDailyHeadline(s)`** added to `home-view.ts` — rules-based 2-sentence insight card on the Home tab, above the readiness ring.
- Synthesises 7 signals in priority order: recovery debt (red → orange), HRV delta vs 7-day average, sleep streak (poor nights), recent cross-training load (last 48h, from `garminActuals` + `adhocWorkouts`), ACWR status.
- Each rule produces a headline + contextual body that differs based on whether today's session is hard or easy.
- Returns `''` when nothing notable — no noise card shown when conditions are fine.
- **`docs/BEVEL.md`** created: full competitive analysis, feature wishlist (sleep stages, Sleep Bank, strain, daily narrative, HRV trends, chatbot), UX notes from Bevel screenshots.
- **`docs/UX_PATTERNS.md`**: three new sections — Daily Insight Card anatomy, Recovery Metric Tiles, Sleep Stage Breakdown Rows.

## 2026-03-22 — Forecast chart redesign + visual constraints

- **Forecast load chart**: replaced multi-colour bar chart with a continuous area chart — historical TSS (solid blue) flows into planned TSS (dashed blue, lighter fill). Phase labels (Base/Build/Peak/Taper) appear as small grey text under each future week's date tick. No legend, no categorical colouring.
- **CTL chart**: removed all intermediate dots; line-only with no point markers.
- **UX_PATTERNS.md**: added `Visual Constraints` section (max 2 colours, no decorative elements) and `Chart type rules` (ban bar charts for time-series; forecast continuation pattern).
- **CLAUDE.md**: added pre-flight step 4 — "Visual constraints checked" before any UI code.

## 2026-03-22 — Stats: CTL "Learn more" page

- **CTL Learn more page**: Added "Learn more →" button to the Running Fitness Trend (CTL) chart in the Progress detail page. Tapping opens a full sub-page explaining what CTL measures, how it's calculated (including cross-training discounts), a range table with 6 tiers (Building → Elite, using the actual code thresholds at 20/40/58/75/95), how to build CTL safely, and what to expect during taper. Back button returns to the Progress detail page. Current tier highlighted inline.

## 2026-03-22 — Stats: HRV baseline spectrum, dot removal, sleep neutral bars, chart clean-up

- **HRV card redesigned**: Area chart replaced with Garmin-style baseline spectrum. Computes 28-day mean ± 1 stddev as a personal normal range, marks 7-day avg on the spectrum. Status label: Balanced / Low / High. Area chart kept below for trend context. Color changed to neutral gray.
- **Dots removed**: End-of-line dots removed from ACWR trend chart and `buildPhysioChartWithBaseline`. Clean lines only.
- **ACWR reference line labels removed**: Lines at 1.3/1.5 kept, labels stripped — spectrum bar above already explains the zones.
- **Sleep bars neutral**: Uniform `rgba(0,0,0,0.18)` instead of red/green per score. Zone label below headline retains color.
- **HRV + RHR cards**: Removed `cursor:pointer` and `SCROLL_CHEVRON` — no click-through exists for these cards.

## 2026-03-22 — Illness mode

- **Illness modal**: Check-in → Ill now opens a real modal asking "Still running (reduced intensity)" or "Full rest". Sets `illnessState` on state.
- **Illness banner (Plan + Home)**: Amber banner with thermometer icon, day counter, severity pill, and reassurance copy. "Mark as recovered" / "Recovered" button clears state.
- **Adherence gate**: During illness, VDOT week-advance adherence multiplier bypassed (treated as 1.0) — skips don't compound fitness reduction with an artificial penalty.
- **No plan mutation**: Workouts untouched; user drags/skips as normal.

---

## 2026-03-22 — Stats page polish: color reduction, section breaks, sleep, TSB

- **Color reduction**: All big metric numbers (Freshness, Injury Risk, HRV, RHR, Sleep, CTL) now always render in `var(--c-black)`; color preserved only for the zone/status badge below.
- **Spectrum bar labels**: Removed all zone labels from the bar row — now shows only the active zone label below the bar (cleaner, no crowding).
- **TSB chart flat line**: Y-axis now data-driven (data range + 30% padding) instead of fixed ±30 span. Chart now shows variation clearly.
- **"Overreached" → "Well Rested"**: TSB > +12 (daily-equiv) relabelled to "Well Rested"; color updated to green.
- **Section breaks in Readiness detail**: "Load" and "Recovery" section dividers added above Freshness/Injury Risk and HRV/RHR/Sleep groups.
- **Section breaks in Stats opening screen**: Thin divider lines added between Progress / Fitness / Readiness cards.
- **Sleep card**: Now merges `recoveryHistory` manual sleep entries for dates Garmin hasn't filled. Entire card is tappable → opens sleep sheet.
- **Sleep detail button removed**: The floating "Sleep detail →" button on the Readiness detail page and in `buildRecoveryAccordionBody` removed. Sleep access is now via tapping the card.

## 2026-03-22 — Redesign: Readiness detail page card layout

- **`src/ui/stats-view.ts`** — All five metric cards (Freshness, Injury Risk, HRV, Resting HR, Sleep) + Running Fitness card redesigned: value moved from 16px right-aligned to 30px/weight-300 left-aligned headline; zone label below value in matching color; card title now 11px uppercase with letter-spacing; time window label (8-week / 7 days / 7 nights) in top-right with chevron replacing the old value cluster; padding 16px → 20px for breathing room; captions 10px → 11px.
- **`buildInlineSpectrumBar`**: bar height 6px → 8px, border-radius 3px → 4px, zone labels 8px → 9px, label row height 18px → 20px.
- **`buildACWRTrendChart`**: removed redundant 1.0 reference line; replaced unlabelled threshold lines with labeled "Elevated 1.3" / "High Risk 1.5"; removed SVG `<text>` element (distorted by `preserveAspectRatio="none"`) and deleted the 3 variables that only served it.

---

## 2026-03-22 — Fix: run activities logged via review screen now count as runs for load

- **`src/calculations/activity-matcher.ts`** (`addAdhocWorkoutFromPending`): fixed `t` always being `'cross'` — now correctly uses `'easy'` when `item.appType === 'run'`, matching the behaviour of `addAdhocWorkout`.
- **`src/calculations/fitness-model.ts`** (`computeWeekTSS`): adhoc workouts with a run `t` type (`easy`, `long`, `tempo`, etc.) now use `runSpec=1.0` regardless of the activity display name. Fixes activities like "General Sport 1" that were runs but got Signal A load computed at the default `0.35` cross-training discount.

## 2026-03-22 — Stats: flat metric cards on Readiness detail (revised)

- Stats landing kept as original 3-pillar cards. New flat metric scroll now lives inside Readiness detail page.
- `buildReadinessDetailPage()` replaced accordion with flat cards: Freshness · Injury Risk · HRV · Resting HR · Sleep.
- `buildACWRTrendChart()`: reference labels moved from SVG text to HTML spans to fix scaling distortion. Dots removed except last point.
- `buildPhysioChartWithBaseline()`: removed distorted floating SVG "avg" label.

## 2026-03-22 — Stats: flat metric dashboard redesign

- **`src/ui/stats-view.ts`**: Replaced the 3-pillar opening screen (Progress / Fitness / Readiness cards) with a flat single-scroll layout. Each metric is a self-contained card: header row (title + value + trend arrow + chevron), spectrum bar above the chart (where applicable), fully-labelled chart, 1-line context note.
- New cards: Freshness (TSB) · Injury Risk (ACWR) · HRV (RMSSD) · Resting HR · Sleep · Running Fitness (CTL). Plan Progress card retained at top.
- New `buildInlineSpectrumBar()`: compact 6px bar with white gap marker and zone labels — used for Freshness, Injury Risk, Running Fitness.
- New `buildDailyLineChartGap()`: gap-aware 7-day line chart. Null entries render as a visual break (M/L path split) with a faint dash tick. Dashed baseline reference for HRV and RHR. Hi/lo Y-axis labels.
- HRV and RHR cards show 7-day gap-aware line; trend arrow (green ↑ for HRV, green ↓ for RHR); 7-day and 28-day avg in context line.
- Sleep card reuses existing `buildBarChart` from sleep-insights. CTL card reuses `buildCTLLineChart`.
- Detail pages (Readiness, Fitness, Progress) unchanged — still reachable by tapping cards. Wiring updated in `renderStatsView`.

## 2026-03-22 — Fix: new week shown as fully missed after Sunday wrap-up

- **`src/ui/plan-view.ts`** (`buildCalendarStrip`, `buildWorkoutCards`): Added `weekHasStarted` guard. When the user wraps up the week on Sunday and `s.w` advances to the next week (which starts Monday), the day-of-week index check `dayIdx < today` was marking Mon–Sat as "Missed" immediately. Fix: if the new week's start date is after today, no days are past.

## 2026-03-22 — Recovery card: stale sleep suppression + manual sleep entry

- **`src/calculations/readiness.ts`**: Added `suppressSleepIfNotToday` option to `computeRecoveryScore`. When today's Garmin sleep entry is absent and no manual entry exists, `sleepScore` is set to null — excluded from the composite and the bar is hidden entirely.
- **`src/calculations/readiness.ts`**: Sleep acute modifier now only applies when `lastNightSleepDate === today`. Removed `isSleepDataPending()` dependency from label logic.
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`**: When no sleep data for today, the Sleep sub-score bar is suppressed. Only the "No sleep data from Garmin yet · Log manually" prompt shows in that section.
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`**: Added `showManualSleepPicker()` — centred overlay (per UX_PATTERNS.md) with a 1–10 number grid (×10 → 0–100 score). Saves to `recoveryHistory` with `source: 'manual'`, injected before `computeRecoveryScore`.
- **`docs/UX_PATTERNS.md`**: Added "Overlays and Modals" section — always centred, never bottom-anchored.
- **`CLAUDE.md`**: Added overlay positioning rule with UX_PATTERNS.md reference.

## 2026-03-22 — Stats: Forecast tab on Total Load (TSS) chart

- **`src/ui/stats-view.ts`**: Added `'forecast'` to `ChartRange` type. New `buildForecastLoadChart()` renders a bar chart of planned TSS for each remaining week in the plan, with bars coloured by training phase (blue=Base, orange=Build, purple=Peak, yellow=Taper). Current week bar is fully opaque with a dashed "Now" marker; future weeks at 70% opacity. Phase legend shown below chart.
- Added `buildProgressRangeToggle()` — a variant of the range pill that includes an additional "Forecast" button. Used in the Progress detail page instead of `buildRangeToggle`.
- `wireProgressRangeButtons`: early-returns on `'forecast'` to show the forecast chart without touching km/CTL charts.

## 2026-03-21 — Fix: run matched to General Sport slot now labelled "Run" and counted in running km

- **`src/ui/activity-review.ts`**: Store `activityType` in `GarminActual` for runs matched via the review/matching screen (was only set on the auto-complete path). Both run-matching call sites updated.
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`**: Updated `isRunKey` to accept an optional `activityType` arg — checks activity type first, falls back to slot-key keyword scan. Updated km filter and activity log `isRun` check to pass `activityType`. Activity label now prefers `formatActivityType(activityType)` over slot name so a run matched to a cross slot shows "Run" not "General Sport 1".
- **`src/ui/stats-view.ts`**: `runKmFromWeek` updated same way — checks `activityType` before keyword scan.
- **`src/state/persistence.ts`**: Migration `isRunKey` updated to check `activityType`.

## 2026-03-21 — Readiness detail page: accordion redesign

- **`src/ui/stats-view.ts`**: Replaced the old "Recovery & Physiology + Training Load slabs" layout with 3 accordion rows matching the home page order: **Freshness → Injury Risk → Recovery**. Each row shows the current value + coloured zone bar. Tap to expand: Freshness shows 8-week TSB trend; Injury Risk shows 8-week ACWR trend (with 1.0/1.3/1.5 reference lines); Recovery shows Sleep (bar chart + detail button), HRV (area chart with 28-day baseline reference line + value label), Resting HR (same). HRV chart now clearly titled "HRV (RMSSD)" with personal average shown. Removed dead `buildTSBMetricPage`, `buildRecoveryPhysiologySection`, and old readiness wire functions.

## 2026-03-21 — Background sleep poller + accurate sleep date label

- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`**: Sleep label in recovery pill sheet now shows "Last night" only when `lastNightSleepDate` is today or yesterday. Older data shows the actual date (e.g. "19 Mar: 54/100") so stale data is immediately obvious. `lastNightSleepDate` added to `PillSheetData` and wired from `recoveryResult2`.

## 2026-03-21 — Background sleep poller

- **`src/data/sleepPoller.ts`** (new): polls `syncPhysiologySnapshot(7)` every 3 minutes when today's sleep score is absent. Self-terminates when data arrives or after 6 hours. Exports `startSleepPollerIfNeeded()` and `isSleepDataPending()`.
- **`src/main.ts`**: calls `startSleepPollerIfNeeded()` at the end of both Garmin sync branches (Strava+Garmin and Garmin-only) so polling begins immediately after launch if sleep is missing.
- **`src/ui/stats-view.ts`**: readiness card sleep section shows a grey "Waiting for Garmin to send sleep data" label when `isSleepDataPending()` is true and today's score hasn't arrived yet. When data arrives the poller re-renders the active view automatically.

## 2026-03-20 — Recovery advice sheet: specific session actions

- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`**: `showRecoveryAdviceSheet()` now detects today's unrated quality session. If found: shows session-specific "Convert to easy run" / "Run by feel" button (calls `applyRecoveryAdjustment('downgrade')`) and "Move to [Day]" button (writes `wk.workoutMoves`, saves, re-renders). Back-to-back detection: if yesterday was a rated hard session, surfaces a warning. Generic rest/reorder/reduce rows shown only when no quality session is detected today. Imports added: `getMutableState`, `saveState`, `isHardWorkout`, `applyRecoveryAdjustment`.
- **`CLAUDE.md`**: Added UI Copy writing style guide (consultant tone, no wellness padding, reference examples, anti-pattern table).
- **Fix**: Removed `|| true` debug hack from Adjust button; added ACWR gate so the button routes to `triggerACWRReduction()` only when ACWR is elevated or unspent items exist.

## 2026-03-20 — Week debrief "Continue" now navigates to Plan

- **`src/ui/week-debrief.ts`**: Fixed `_closeAndRecord` in `review` mode — was calling `renderHomeView()`, now uses dynamic import to call `renderPlanView()`. Dynamic import required to avoid circular dependency (`plan-view.ts` → `week-debrief.ts`).
- **`CLAUDE.md`**: Added Navigation Rules section documenting this pattern.

## 2026-03-20 — Load & Taper page

- **`src/ui/load-taper-view.ts`** (new): Full-page Load & Taper view. Shows this week's TSS bar + "See breakdown →" button (opens existing modal), TSS range explainer (150/350/500 thresholds), all four plan phases with descriptions (Base/Build/Peak/Taper) with the current phase highlighted, and a "Why taper makes you faster" science card. Back button returns to plan or home.
- **`src/ui/plan-view.ts`**: `plan-load-bar-row` click now navigates to the Load & Taper page instead of opening the inline modal.
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`**: `home-tss-row` click now navigates to the Load & Taper page instead of opening the inline modal.

## 2026-03-20 — Stats page full redesign: three-pillar architecture (Progress · Fitness · Readiness)

- **`src/ui/stats-view.ts`**: Complete rewrite of the Stats page. Opening screen now shows four stacked sections: Progress card, Fitness card, Readiness card, and a flat Summary section. Each of the three primary cards taps into a dedicated single-scroll detail page with no tabs inside. Progress card shows a race-mode arc/timeline with forecast finish + on-track pill, or a fitness-mode tier progress bar for non-race users. Fitness card shows compact VDOT sparkline + VDOT value + tier label. Readiness card shows a Freshness scale bar with a properly positioned floating marker (`left: pct%` via absolute positioning — the ⓘ info icon is moved to the row title, no longer anchored to the bar left edge). Progress detail page has Phase Timeline, Training Load line chart, Running Distance line chart, and CTL line chart — all with 8w/16w/all range toggle. Fitness detail page has scale bars (Running Fitness/Aerobic Capacity/Lactate Threshold), a VDOT trend line chart with range toggle, plus race forecast and training paces. Readiness detail page has scale bars for Freshness/Short-Term Load/Load Safety/Fitness Momentum, a Freshness trend line chart with zone bands, and a Recovery & Physiology section rendered fully expanded (no accordion). All charts use SVG line/area — no bar charts anywhere. Summary section shows race predictions (Marathon/Half/10K/5K) in race mode and training paces in both modes. Scale bars now use raw TSB units (-60 to +40) per spec; ATL scale extended to 150 to match spec. Removed: old "This Week" summary card, old "Fitness" summary card with CTL number, old "More detail" accordion, Zones tab, zone stack chart.

## 2026-03-19 — Feature: Week Overview + coach insight + future week draft treatment

- **`src/calculations/coach-insight.ts`** (new): `computeWeekSignals` — maps effortScore, tssPct, ctlDelta, HR drift → 4 signal states. `getSignalPills` — coloured pill data for UI. `getCoachCopy` — 9-case RPE×Load decision tree with secondary modifiers (fitness direction, HR drift); returns `null` for novel/sparse combinations. `getFutureWeekCopy` — VDOT + phase + race proximity sentence for future weeks; race note guarded by `hasRace` flag. `PILL_COLORS` exported for shared use. Thresholds aligned with existing debrief logic (±1.0).
- **`src/ui/plan-view.ts`**: "Week Overview" / "About this week" expandable toggle added below load bar. Current/past weeks: signal pills (Effort, Load, Fitness, Aerobic) + coach paragraph. Future weeks: VDOT + Phase + Load + Race chips; detailed copy naming each factor (fitness, load budget, block structure, race proximity); card list at 75% opacity; "Draft · distances ±10% · paces update weekly" banner. `fmtDescRange` helper rewrites workout descriptions with ±10% distance ranges on future week cards. `Mark as Done` / `Skip` buttons hidden for future weeks. Chevron animates on expand/collapse. Coach block hidden when effort adjustment prompt is already showing to avoid duplicate messaging.
- **`src/ui/week-debrief.ts`**: Coach block (signal pills + paragraph) injected between metrics rows and effort adjustment prompt. Hidden when `showPacing` is true (effort prompt takes precedence). Uses shared `PILL_COLORS` and existing `tssPct` — no recomputation.

## 2026-03-19 — Fix: readiness TSB and ACWR now include current week's actuals

- **`src/calculations/fitness-model.ts`**: `computeSameSignalTSB` and `computeACWR` now extend their loop by 1 to include the current in-progress week (`limit = currentWeek + 1` capped at `wks.length`). Previously, today's completed activities (garminActuals, adhocWorkouts) were invisible to ATL — so Freshness stayed "+20 Fresh" and ACWR stayed low regardless of what the athlete had done that day. `computeWeekRawTSS` only counts synced actuals, so the value is 0 when nothing has been done and correctly reflects completed load once activities sync.

---

## 2026-03-19 — Stats page redesign v2 (area charts, less navigation, race status)

- **`src/ui/stats-view.ts`**: `buildMiniTSSSparkline` converted from bars to smooth area/line (SVG path via `smoothAreaPath`). New `buildMiniVdotSparkline` for Fitness summary card — shows VDOT trend as a small area chart inline. New `buildRaceStatusBanner` for race mode users — Starting/Today/Forecast grid + progress bar shown inside the Fitness card. `buildReadinessSummaryCard` now shows TSB, ACWR, and sleep score as inline data rows. New `buildVdotSparklineLarge` (full-width, 72px, area fill) for the Fitness detail page. `buildFitnessDetailPage` now leads with VDOT sparkline above progress bars. `buildThisWeekDetailPage`: Load/Distance/Zones tab switcher killed — single load chart + 8w/16w toggle only; distance shown as stat below chart. `buildReadinessDetailPage`: segmented control removed — Training Load + Recovery on single scroll. `wireChartTabs`: simplified to range-only (no chart type tabs).

---

## 2026-03-19 — Garmin backfill guard: permanent → 12h TTL

- **`src/data/supabaseClient.ts`**: Replaced the permanent `mosaic_garmin_backfill_empty` localStorage guard with a 12-hour TTL (`mosaic_garmin_backfill_empty_until`). **Root cause of recurring sleep not pulling**: the old guard fired permanently on the first app launch of the day (often before the morning watch sync completes), blocking all subsequent backfill attempts. The new guard expires after 12 hours so the next launch retries — after the watch has synced. Old permanent guard key is cleared on first run of the new code (migration). On success with >0 rows, guard is cleared entirely so every launch checks for fresh data.

---

## 2026-03-19 — Home: activity dates + unmatched activity display

- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`**: Recent activity list now shows actual dates (e.g. "Mon 17 Mar") instead of "Last week"/"This week", using `act.startTime` for garminActuals and `w.garminTimestamp` for adhoc workouts. Unmatched activities (garminPending items with `__pending__` state) now surface in the Recent section with an amber "Unmatched" pill tag; tapping opens the activity review flow via `window.openActivityReReview()`.

---

## 2026-03-19 — Stats page redesign (3-card Whoop-style layout)

- **`src/ui/stats-view.ts`**: Replaced cluttered multi-section layout with 3 clean summary cards ("This Week", "Fitness", "Readiness"), each tapping to a full detail page. Tier pill removed — replaced by VDOT + direction arrow (↑→↓). ACWR pill only shows when elevated/high. Readiness driving signal pill only when score < 60. "This Week" detail: Load / Distance / Zones chart + 8w/16w range. "Fitness" detail: progress bars + VDOT history + forecast times. "Readiness" detail: segmented control (Training Load | Sleep & HRV). `computeReadiness`, `readinessColor`, `drivingSignalLabel` added to imports.

---

## 2026-03-12 — Load Budget Spec: total-week Signal B excess model

- **`src/calculations/fitness-model.ts`**: New `computePlannedSignalB()` = `computePlannedWeekTSS()` + sum of `sportBaselineByType[sport].avgSessionRawTSS × sessionsPerWeek`. Plan bar and excess detection now compare Signal B vs Signal B (no cross-signal mismatch).
- **`src/calculations/readiness.ts`**: New `computeRecoveryTrend(history, days=5)` → returns recovery multiplier (1.0/1.15/1.30/1.50) based on 5-day HRV/sleep/RHR composite. Degrades to 1.0 without watch data.
- **`src/data/stravaSync.ts`**: `signalBBaseline` now uses **median** of weekly rawTSS (was simple average). Resistant to injury/rest weeks dragging the baseline down.
- **`src/ui/plan-view.ts`**: Plan bar target switches from `computePlannedWeekTSS()` to `computePlannedSignalB()`. Adjust week row now triggers on total week Signal B excess > 15 TSS (was: only when unspentLoadItems present).
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`**: Load breakdown sheet uses `computePlannedSignalB()` for target. Footer now shows composite: Running planned / Cross-training expected / Total target.
- **`src/ui/excess-load-card.ts`**: Completely reworked. Detection now uses total week Signal B vs `computePlannedSignalB()` — matching is irrelevant. Card shows at Tier 2 (15–40 TSS excess). `triggerExcessLoadAdjustment()` computes `reductionTSS = excess × weightedRunSpec × recoveryMultiplier`. Removed unspent-items popup and leg-impact sheet (dead in new model). Dismiss now writes a suppression mod instead of clearing items.
- **`src/cross-training/suggester.ts`**: `buildCrossTrainingPopup()` accepts optional `recoveryMultiplier` param. Inflates `runReplacementCredit` (capped at +20 TSS equivalent guardrail per spec §6).

---

## 2026-03-12 — Time-based recovery segments with countdown UI

- **`src/types/gps.ts`**: Added `durationSeconds?: number` to `SplitSegment`. When set, segment advances by elapsed time rather than distance.
- **`src/gps/split-scheme.ts`**: Recovery segments in `buildIntervalScheme` and `buildTimeIntervalScheme` now use `{ distance: 0, durationSeconds: restSeconds }` instead of an estimated distance. `totalDistance` correctly excludes recovery (distance 0).
- **`src/gps/tracker.ts`**: `checkSplitBoundary()` branches on `durationSeconds` vs `distance` for advancement. `getCurrentSplitData()` now populates `elapsed` for the in-progress segment. New `tick()` method called by the 1-second timer so time-based segments auto-advance without needing a GPS point.
- **`src/ui/gps-events.ts`**: 1-second timer now calls `activeTracker.tick()` before reading live data.
- **`src/ui/record-view.ts`**: Recovery segment card shows "X left — Walk or light jog". In the last 5 seconds, displays a large `5 4 3 2 1` countdown. Segment list shows formatted duration (e.g. "90s", "2:00") for time-based segments instead of distance.

---

## 2026-03-12 — ISSUE-86: Fix disproportionate Reduce/Replace recommendation

- **`src/ui/suggestion-modal.ts`**: Added `pctAboveCeiling` and `pctAboveBaseline` — the former is excess above the safety ceiling (was the only value, wrongly labelled "above your normal load"), the latter is `(ratio − 1) × 100` = actual load vs baseline. `humanConsequence` now references baseline. When ceiling overshoot ≤ 5%, copy reads "Your load is just above the safe ceiling (1.63× vs 1.60×). A small adjustment is enough." Rule 1 zoneAdvice updated to use baseline %.
- **`src/ui/main-view.ts`**: Lowered synthetic activity duration floor from `Math.max(20, …)` → `Math.max(5, …)` when synthesising ACWR-excess load. Eliminates 3× inflation for small overages (e.g. 6 TSS excess → 7 min, no longer bumped to 20 min).

---

## 2026-03-12 — Fix: TSS mismatch between home bar and Weekly Load Breakdown modal

- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`**: `buildProgressBars` now always uses `computePlannedWeekTSS` for the TSS target — removes the `signalBBaseline` fallback which ignored phase multipliers (was showing 230 instead of 165 on current week).
- **`src/main.ts`**: After `syncStravaActivities()` and `syncActivities()` complete, re-renders the home view if it is still active (`#home-tss-row` in DOM). Previously the home TSS bar was stale (rendered before sync ran), causing the displayed actual to diverge from the modal.

---

## 2026-03-12 — ISSUE-106: Cross-training planned TSS: historical calibration + hide misleading bars

- **`src/calculations/fitness-model.ts`**: Added `computeCrossTrainTSSPerMin(wks, sportKey)` — scans garminActuals across all weeks, computes median TSS/min for a given sport using iTrimp-based TSS (`iTrimp * 100 / 15000`). Returns null if < 2 samples.
- **`src/ui/plan-view.ts`**: For `w.t === 'cross'` or `w.t === 'gym'`, planned TSS now uses: (1) historical iTrimp rate × duration when ≥2 samples exist; (2) `TL_PER_MIN[rpe] × durMin × sportRunSpec` as fallback (e.g. 0.40 for generic_sport) — avoids ~7× inflation vs iTrimp scale. Running sessions unchanged.
- **`src/ui/plan-view.ts`**: Planned vs actual load bars suppressed for matched cross-training sessions — RPE-assumed HR rarely matches actual sport HR, making the comparison misleading. Future unmatched cross-training still shows `~X TSS` estimate using corrected formula.
- **`src/ui/plan-view.ts`**: `data-planned-tss` set to 0 for cross-training when opening activity-detail — no planned bar shown there either.

---

## 2026-03-12 — ISSUE-20: km splits now sourced from Strava splits_metric

- **`supabase/functions/sync-strava-activities/index.ts`** (standalone mode): For new runs, calls `/activities/{id}` to get `splits_metric` directly from Strava. Pace = `moving_time * 1000 / distance` sec/km per split — exact match to Strava's displayed splits. Falls back to stream-based `calculateKmSplits` if the detail fetch fails.
- Same file: Cached runs with `km_splits: null` now fetch `splits_metric` on next sync and patch the DB.
- ISSUE-28 confirmed on device, marked ✅.

---

## 2026-03-12 — ISSUE-88: km/mile toggle now applies everywhere

- **`src/ui/plan-view.ts`**: Added `import { formatKm }` from `@/utils/format`. Updated all hardcoded `".toFixed(1) km"` distance displays in `buildWorkoutExpandedDetail`, `buildActivityLog` (added `getState()` call), and `buildWorkoutCards` to use `formatKm(km, s.unitPref ?? 'km')`. Handles string-typed `distKm` defensively.
- **`src/ui/home-view.ts`**: Updated `buildTodayWorkout` (Distance meta item), `buildNoWorkoutHero` (next workout label), and `buildRecentActivity` (activity feed rows) to use `formatKm` with `s.unitPref`.
- Docs: Marked ISSUE-88, ISSUE-87, ISSUE-100, ISSUE-93 ✅ fixed. Removed ISSUE-89 (TSS "estimated") and ISSUE-101 (recovery bar) as confirmed resolved.

---

## 2026-03-12 — ISSUE-28: Retroactive RPE editing + auto-push uncompleted sessions

- **`src/ui/plan-view.ts`**: Added `data-week-num="${viewWeek}"` to both `plan-action-mark-done` buttons and the `plan-action-skip` button in `buildWorkoutCards()`. Click handlers now read `el.dataset.weekNum` and pass it to `rate()` / `skip()` as `targetWeek`.
- **`src/ui/events.ts`** (`rate()`): Added optional `targetWeek?: number` param. For past weeks (`targetWeek < s.w`), records `wk.rated[workoutId] = rpe` and returns early — skipping VDOT/rpeAdj/LT updates.
- **`src/ui/events.ts`** (`skip()`): Added optional `targetWeek?: number` param. For past weeks, marks the session as 'skip' in-place (no push to next week).
- **`src/ui/week-debrief.ts`**: Added `_handleUncompletedSessions()` — called from the "Complete week →" button before `_closeAndRecord`. Finds sessions that are unrated AND not already in the week's skip list. If any exist, replaces the CTA area with a two-button prompt ("Move to next week" / "Drop them"). "Move to next week" pushes each session to `wks[weekNum].skip` using the standard skip entry structure. CTA button wrapped in `<div id="debrief-cta-area">` to enable inline replacement.

---

## 2026-03-12 — Sleep sheet polish

- **`sleep-insights.ts`** (`BarChartEntry`): Added optional `subLabel` field — rendered as a small row below the day name. Used for duration labels ("7h 22m") under each nightly bar.
- **`home-view.ts`** (`showSleepSheet`): Duration subLabels now appear under each bar in the 7-night chart. Added derived **Light sleep** bar (duration − deep − REM − awake). Added **stages placeholder** when score is present but stages are null: *"Duration and stage breakdown will appear after your next Garmin Connect sync."*
- **`docs/OPEN_ISSUES.md`**: Logged ISSUE-89 — sleep debt tracker (P2 future build).

---

## 2026-03-12 — Sleep UI overhaul

- **`sleep-insights.ts`**: Added `sleepScoreLabel()`, `getSleepContext()` (vs personal history + 7–9h population target), and `buildBarChart()` — clean filled bar chart renderer used across sleep screens.
- **`home-view.ts`**: New `showSleepSheet()` — score + duration side-by-side with contextualisation (avg, best, vs target), Deep/REM/Awake stage bars, 7-night filled bar chart, stale-data banner ("Data last synced DD/MM. Open Garmin Connect to resync.").
- **`home-view.ts`** (recovery modal): Sleep row now shows last night's raw score as rawLine. Composite one-liner added. Sleep row is clickable → opens sleep sheet directly. "View full breakdown in Stats" renamed "Sleep detail" and opens sheet instead of navigating to Stats.
- **`stats-view.ts`**: Replaced `buildPhysioMiniChart` sparklines with `buildBarChart` clean filled bar charts for Sleep, HRV, and Resting HR. Sleep section now shows inline bar chart + Sleep detail button.
- **`format.ts`**: Added `fmtDateUK()` — formats YYYY-MM-DD as DD/MM (UK format).
- **`main-view.ts`**: Sleep dot history uses DD/MM date labels.

---

## 2026-03-12 — Feature: Intelligent Workout Commentary (ISSUE-35 Build 3)

- **`workout-insight.ts`**: New `generateWorkoutInsight()` — rules-based engine picks top 2-3 coaching insights from: pace adherence, HR effort score, HR drift, split consistency (CV, negative split, late fade), and HR zone distribution. Coaching/direct tone, all activity types.
- **`activity-detail.ts`**: "Coach's Notes" card rendered below training load on the activity detail screen. Only appears when there's something useful to say.

---

## 2026-03-12 — Feature: HR drift computed from Strava HR streams (ISSUE-35 Build 2)

- **`stream-processor.ts`**: New `computeHRDrift()` — splits HR stream in half (after stripping 10% warmup), compares avg HR. Only for runs ≥ 20 min with ≥ 60 valid HR points.
- **Edge function** (`sync-strava-activities`): Inline `calculateHRDrift()` added. Computed for running types alongside iTRIMP/hrZones. Stored in DB `hr_drift` column. Returned in response rows.
- **DB migration**: `20260312_hr_drift.sql` — adds `hr_drift real` column to `garmin_activities`.
- **Client data flow**: `GarminActivityRow.hrDrift` → `GarminActual.hrDrift` during matching. Enrichment backfill + stravaSync patching.
- **Effort score**: Drift > 5% on easy/long runs adds bonus deviation (capped at +1.0 RPE-equivalent) to blended effort score.
- **Adaptive note**: Future weeks surface high drift context.

---

## 2026-03-12 — Feature: Sleep morning re-sync + null tap target + REM bar

- **Morning re-sync** (`supabaseClient.ts`): new `refreshRecentSleepScores()` bypasses backfill guard, calls `garmin-backfill` with `weeks=1`. Triggered from `main.ts` after physiology sync when today's sleep score is missing — picks up Garmin's server-computed score (available 1–4h post-wake).
- **Null tap target**: "Sleep —" chip always shown when watch is connected, even when today's score is pending. Tapping it opens the sleep sheet showing yesterday's data and history.
- **REM bar**: added to sleep detail sheet alongside deep sleep (purple) and awake time.

---

## 2026-03-12 — Feature: Sleep detail sheet + Garmin sleep stages pipeline

- **Migration** `20260311120000_sleep_stages.sql`: adds `duration_sec`, `deep_sec`, `rem_sec`, `awake_sec` to `sleep_summaries` table.
- **`garmin-webhook`**: removed broken `qualifierKey` string fallback + estimation fallback; now stores Garmin's real score (or null) plus all 4 stage durations.
- **`garmin-backfill`**: updated `GarminSleep` interface and upsert to include stage fields.
- **`sync-physiology-snapshot`**: selects and returns all 4 stage fields in merged day rows.
- **`PhysiologyDayEntry`**: added `sleepDurationSec`, `sleepDeepSec`, `sleepRemSec`, `sleepAwakeSec` fields.
- **`physiologySync.ts`**: maps new stage fields from DB rows.
- **`sleep-insights.ts`** (new): training-linked insight generator — post-hard-week, bad streak, good streak, bounce-back, debt, trend.
- **`home-view.ts`**: sleep score in recovery caption is now coloured + clickable; opens `showSleepSheet()` bottom sheet with score, duration, deep/awake bars, 7-night chips, and insight.
- **`stats-view.ts`**: sleep row shows 7-day average + insight sentence + "Full sleep breakdown" button.

---

## 2026-03-12 — Feature: HR effort + pace adherence signals feed plan engine (ISSUE-35 Build 1)

- **HR Effort Score**: `computeHREffortScore()` in `heart-rate.ts` — compares actual avgHR (from Strava) to target HR zone for the workout type. Score: 0.8 = undercooked, 1.0 = on target, 1.2 = overcooked. Stored on `GarminActual.hrEffortScore`.
- **Pace Adherence**: `computePaceAdherence()` in `activity-matcher.ts` — actual pace / target pace ratio. 1.0 = nailed it, >1.0 = slower than target. Stored on `GarminActual.paceAdherence`. Target pace derived from VDOT tables per workout type.
- **Blended effort score**: `events.ts` now blends RPE + HR + pace into `wk.effortScore`. Quality sessions (threshold, VO2, MP) weight pace at 35%; easy runs at 15%. Missing pace on quality work is the strongest signal.
- **Enrichment backfill**: Existing matched activities get `hrEffortScore` and `paceAdherence` retroactively computed on next sync.
- **Adaptive plan note**: Future weeks in plan-view show a note explaining workouts adjust based on effort, HR, pace, and load safety. Includes context-aware detail (e.g. "you missed pace targets on recent quality sessions").
- **Plan engine verified**: All 8 factors (phase, VDOT, deload, effort, ACWR, injury, runner type, race distance) confirmed wired and composing correctly.

---

## 2026-03-11 — Fix: Wire effortScore + acwrStatus into all generateWeekWorkouts() call sites

- **`src/calculations/fitness-model.ts`**: Exported `getTrailingEffortScore()` (was local to `renderer.ts`) — computes trailing RPE from last 2 completed non-injury weeks
- **15 call sites wired**: `home-view.ts` (3), `plan-view.ts` (2), `events.ts` (5), `renderer.ts` (1), `main-view.ts` (1), `activity-review.ts` (1), `recording-handler.ts` (1), `timing-check.ts` (1) — all now pass `effortScore` and `wk.scheduledAcwrStatus`
- **Effect**: plan engine's duration scaling (5–15% reduction when RPE runs high) and quality session stripping (when ACWR elevated) now active everywhere, not just the main renderer

---

## 2026-03-11 — UX: Training Readiness clarity pass

- **Momentum pill** (`home-view.ts`): removed raw CTL number ("Fitness 280"), now shows just `→ Stable` / `↗ Building` / `↘ Declining`
- **Momentum detail sheet** (`home-view.ts`): replaced raw CTL comparison with plain English explanation of what Momentum means and why it's part of Training Readiness; added "See Stats" nudge
- **Stats card header** (`stats-view.ts`): renamed "Recovery" → "Training Readiness" for consistency with home page heading — the card contains Freshness, Load Safety, and ACWR alongside watch recovery data
- **Stats Momentum bar** (`stats-view.ts`): added Momentum position bar to the Training Readiness card — shows 4-week CTL trend as Building/Stable/Declining with info tooltip explaining what it means. Subtitle shows "Running Fitness: X → Y over 4 weeks" tying it to the CTL bar in the Progress card above
- **Pill sheet "View in Stats" button** (`home-view.ts`): all readiness pill popups (Freshness, Load Safety, Momentum, Recovery) now have a "View full breakdown in Stats" button at the bottom that closes the popup and navigates to the Stats tab

---

## 2026-03-11 — Feature: Durable plan backup + auto-restore from Supabase

- **`supabase/migrations/20260311_user_plan_settings.sql`**: new `user_plan_settings` table with RLS — one row per user, stores a full plan state snapshot
- **`src/data/planSettingsSync.ts`**: `savePlanSettings()` (fire-and-forget backup after every save) + `restorePlanFromSupabase()` (called only when localStorage is empty)
- **`src/state/persistence.ts`**: `saveState()` now triggers `savePlanSettings()` automatically
- **`src/main.ts`**: `launchApp()` made async; if localStorage is empty on login, silently restores from Supabase before rendering anything
- Large re-fetchable arrays excluded from snapshot (`historicWeeklyTSS`, `physiologyHistory`, etc.) — these are rebuilt from Strava/Garmin sync on first load
- Fixes the scenario where an agent or browser wipe resets the plan and the user has to manually re-enter their start date

---

## 2026-03-11 — UX: Account page redesign (iOS Settings / Whoop style)

- **`account-view.ts`**: Full HTML generation rewrite. All logic, handlers, and element IDs preserved.
  - **Profile header**: centered avatar (initials), display name, athlete tier badge
  - **Section labels**: small-caps, muted, above each group — Connected Apps · Profile · Preferences · Training History · Plan · Advanced
  - **Grouped rows**: single rounded card per section with hairline dividers between rows (no individual cards per item)
  - **Connected app rows**: inline status dot + sublabel; Sync/Remove pill buttons in trailing position
  - **Profile group**: Gender · Runner type · PBs grid · Edit Profile row
  - **Preferences group**: Distance toggle · Max HR · Resting HR · Save button — all as clean rows
  - **Training History group**: avg TSS, km/wk, tier as value rows; Rebuild + Sync History CTAs at bottom
  - **Advanced group**: Reset VDOT · Recover Plan (collapsible `<details>`) · Reset Plan — all in one card
  - **Pending activities**: compact alert banner at top of page (not a separate card)
  - **Sign Out / Exit Simulator**: full-width button at bottom, not in a card
  - Added `sectionLabel()`, `groupCard()`, `rowDivider()`, `chevron()`, `statusDot()`, `iconBox()`, `pillBtn()` helper functions to eliminate repeated inline style boilerplate

---

## 2026-03-10 — Feature: iTRIMP intensity calibration wired to matched plan sessions

- **`state.ts`**: Added `plannedType?: string | null` to `GarminActual` — stores the plan workout type at match time (e.g. `'easy'`, `'long'`, `'threshold'`, `'vo2'`).
- **`activity-matcher.ts`**: Auto-match path now stores `plannedType: match.matchedWorkout.t` on the `GarminActual` at high-confidence match time.
- **`activity-review.ts`**: Manual match paths (both the interactive review flow and the auto-assign past-week flow) now store `plannedType: classifyByName(workoutId)` for run matches, using the workout name as the label source.
- **`stravaSync.ts`**: Added `calibrateFromState()` — reads matched actuals from state, maps `plannedType` → calibration zone via `TYPE_TO_ZONE` table, and applies per-zone guard rails (easy >95 TSS/hr rejected, tempo >160 rejected) to catch mislabelled sessions (e.g. half marathon matched to easy run slot). `calibrateIntensityThresholds()` now calls `calibrateFromState()` first; falls back to the edge-fn (Strava activity name) path only if state has insufficient data. Both paths merge and share `applyCalibration()`.
- **`stats-view.ts`**: Calibration banner hidden until user has ≥5 completed tracked runs (garminActuals with iTrimp > 0 + duration > 10min). "labelled sessions" copy replaced with "matched sessions".

---

## 2026-03-10 — Feature: Load Breakdown Sheet on Home tab

- **`home-view.ts`**: Tapping the "Training Load (TSS)" row on the home page now opens a bottom sheet instead of navigating to Stats. Sheet shows: total TSS vs target, a stacked horizontal bar coloured by sport, per-sport rows with duration + mini-bar + TSS, and a planned target footer. Breakdown mirrors Signal B (full physiological cost, no runSpec discount) and uses the same dedup logic as `computeWeekRawTSS`. Sources: `garminActuals` (runs), `adhocWorkouts` (cross-training), `unspentLoadItems` (overflow).

---

## 2026-03-10 — Fix: Recovery sheet missing Sleep and HRV bars

- **`garmin-backfill/index.ts`**: Fixed Garmin Health API endpoint format — changed `startDate`/`endDate` string params to `startEpoch`/`endEpoch` Unix timestamps (seconds), which is what the API actually accepts. Old format silently returned zero dailies/sleep rows. Added diagnostic logging of sample response shape (keys + field values) so future failures are visible in Supabase function logs.
- **`physiologySync.ts`**: Increased stored history from 7 → 28 days (`.slice(-28)`). `computeRecoveryScore` needs ≥3 HRV readings in its 28-day baseline window; 7 days wasn't enough when HRV data is sparse.
- **`main.ts`**: Updated both `syncPhysiologySnapshot(7)` calls to `syncPhysiologySnapshot(28)` so the edge function actually fetches and returns 28 days of data.
- **Deployed**: `garmin-backfill` redeployed to `elnuiudfndsvtbfisaje`.

---

## 2026-03-10 — Fix: Cross-training load missing from wk.actualTSS

- **`addAdhocWorkout` + `addAdhocWorkoutFromPending`** (`activity-matcher.ts`): Both functions now accumulate Signal B TSS (raw iTRIMP, no runSpec) onto `wk.actualTSS` after adding the workout to `wk.adhocWorkouts`. Fixes ACWR being run-only — padel, gym, surf, cycling now feed fatigue correctly. Covers all six `activity-review.ts` call sites via the shared function.

---

## 2026-03-10 — Progress Card: 3-Bar Fitness System + CTL Scale Alignment

- **Progress card 3-bar system** (`stats-view.ts`): Replaced old 2-bar (CTL + VDOT) with 3 bars — Running Fitness (CTL), Aerobic Capacity (VDOT/VO2max), Lactate Threshold (LT pace). Each bar has inline ⓘ info text.
- **CTL ÷7 display scale** (`stats-view.ts`, `home-view.ts`): All CTL/ATL/TSB display values divided by 7 to match TrainingPeaks daily-equivalent scale. Internal math unchanged (weekly EMA). ATL and TSB also ÷7 in recovery card and "more detail" section.
- **6-zone Coggan CTL system** (`stats-view.ts`): Replaced 4-zone system with 6 zones — Building (<20), Foundation (20-40), Trained (40-58), Well-Trained (58-75), Performance (75-95), Elite (≥95) — matching TP community benchmarks and physiological breakpoints.
- **Aerobic Capacity bar** (`stats-view.ts`): Uses Daniels VDOT (`s.v`) for position; sex-calibrated ACSM zones (male/female breakpoints differ by ~7-10 pts). Garmin VO2max (`s.vo2`) shown as subtitle if available.
- **Lactate Threshold bar** (`stats-view.ts`): LT pace (`s.lt`, sec/km) mapped to 0-100 score (male: 360→0, 160→100; female: 380→0, 180→100). Formatted as min:ss/km. LT HR + % of max HR shown as subtitle when `s.ltHR` is available.
- **`subtitle` wired in `buildOnePositionBar`** (`stats-view.ts`): Optional secondary line rendered below zone labels.
- **athleteTier thresholds corrected** (`stravaSync.ts`): Thresholds updated to weekly-scale equivalents (beginner<140, recreational<280, trained<455, performance<630, high_volume≥630).

---

## 2026-03-09 — Batch 6: Recovery Pipeline + Week Debrief + Activity Card

- **Garmin backfill edge function** (`supabase/functions/garmin-backfill/index.ts`): Pulls N weeks of historic dailies (resting HR, max HR, HRV, stress, VO2max) + sleep from Garmin Health API. Upserts into `daily_metrics` + `sleep_summaries`. Idempotent. Called on startup in both Garmin-only and Strava+Garmin paths (ISSUE-76).
- **`triggerGarminBackfill()`** (`supabaseClient.ts`): Fire-and-forget wrapper for the backfill edge function (ISSUE-76).
- **Recovery Score** (`readiness.ts`): `computeRecoveryScore()` — composite 0–100 from HRV 45% / Sleep 35% / RHR 20%, all relative to user's 28-day personal baseline. Requires ≥3 days data (ISSUE-80).
- **Recovery card with watch data** (`stats-view.ts`): `buildRecoveryCard()` shows Recovery Score position bar + clickable sub-bars (Sleep, HRV, Resting HR with 14-day sparklines). "Connect a watch" placeholder when no data (ISSUE-80).
- **Welcome-back modal killed** (`main.ts`): `showWelcomeBackModal` trigger removed. `detectMissedWeeks()` + `recordAppOpen()` still run for state advancement (ISSUE-81).
- **Week-end debrief** (`src/ui/week-debrief.ts`): New modal sheet — phase badge, load % vs planned, distance, CTL delta, effort pacing adjustment (reads `wk.effortScore`, applies `rpeAdj` cap ±0.5). "Finish week" button added to plan page current week header. Auto-triggers on app open (guarded by `lastDebriefWeek`) (ISSUE-60, ISSUE-34 merged).
- **Activity card stats grid** (`activity-detail.ts`): Fixed 5-cell 3-column grid (Distance, Time, Avg Pace, Avg HR, Max HR) with `—` for missing fields instead of silently omitting them (ISSUE-20).
- **ISSUE-08, ISSUE-19, ISSUE-30 verified resolved**: Stats training bars and home load bars already had labels + values + colour coding. Position bars already have zone labels. No code changes needed.

---

## 2026-03-09 — Stats Page Restructure (ISSUE-72 + ISSUE-73)

- **Chart tabs** (`stats-view.ts`): Main chart card now has Load/Distance/Zones tabs at the top, replacing the hidden "Dig Deeper" accordion. All three charts are first-class, accessible with one tap.
- **Progress card** (`stats-view.ts`): New card with Running Fitness (CTL) and VDOT position bars — the "how am I improving?" section.
- **Recovery card** (`stats-view.ts`): New card with Freshness (TSB), Short-Term Load (ATL), and Load Safety (ACWR) position bars — the "am I recovering?" section.
- **Killed "Dig Deeper"** (`stats-view.ts`): Removed the old accordion and its chart switcher. Distance and Zones charts promoted to main chart card tabs.
- **Killed "Your Numbers" monolith** (`stats-view.ts`): The single 5-bar card split into focused Progress and Recovery cards.
- **"More detail" toggle** (`stats-view.ts`): Replaces "Your Numbers" accordion. Contains training bars, metrics row, ACWR gradient bar, and all folded sections.
- **No hardcoded zone splits** (`stats-view.ts`): Current week zone data returns zeros when no real HR data exists (previously fell back to 60/28/12 hardcoded split).

## 2026-03-08 — Historic Week Editing

- **Edit button on past weeks** (`plan-view.ts`): The ✎ button now appears on past week headers (`viewWeek < s.w`) instead of only the current week. Sheet message updated to explain past-week editing.
- **Past-week RPE / skip buttons** (`plan-view.ts`): `buildWorkoutExpandedDetail` now accepts `currentWeek` param. For past weeks, Mark Done and Skip buttons are enabled — same as current week — unless the workout has a `garminActual` match.
- **Synced-from-watch guard** (`plan-view.ts`): Workouts matched to a Garmin/Strava activity show a "Synced from watch/Strava" read-only label instead of action buttons when viewing a past week.
- **Activity day placement** (`plan-view.ts`): `buildWorkoutCards` now pre-computes effective day-of-week from `garminActual.startTime` for each workout. Cards appear in the day column when the activity was actually performed, not the originally planned day.

## 2026-03-08 — Garmin Token Refresh System

- **New edge function** (`supabase/functions/garmin-refresh-token/index.ts`): Accepts user JWT, looks up `refresh_token` from `garmin_tokens`, calls Garmin OAuth2 token endpoint with `grant_type=refresh_token`, updates DB with new tokens + `expires_at`.
- **Auto-refresh on connect check** (`src/data/supabaseClient.ts`): `isGarminConnected()` now queries `expires_at` — if expired, calls `refreshGarminToken()` before returning. New exported `refreshGarminToken()` function.
- **Account page health info** (`src/ui/account-view.ts`): Garmin card shows "Connected · Last sync: [date]" (from latest `daily_metrics.day_date`) when healthy, or "Token expired" (amber dot) when refresh fails.
- **Webhook logging** (`supabase/functions/garmin-webhook/index.ts`): `handleDailies()` and `handleSleeps()` now log successful upserts with user ID and date.

## 2026-03-08 — Copy Audit (ISSUE-21)

- **Recovery labels** (`main-view.ts`): "Recovery: Log today" → "How are you feeling?", "Recovery: Good" → "Feeling good", "Recovery: Low — Tap to adjust" → "Feeling rough — tap to adjust".
- **Plan today card** (`plan-view.ts`): Removed 🏃 emoji, "Today's planned run" → "Today".
- **Welcome-back modal** (`welcome-back.ts`): Bullet-point copy → plain sentences without `•` prefix.
- **Wizard runner-type** (`runner-type.ts`): "Based on your personal bests, we've assessed your running style." → "Here's your running style, based on your race times."

## 2026-03-08 — Forecast Times Section

- **Forecast times** (`stats-view.ts`): New collapsible section in Stats Advanced area showing predicted 5K, 10K, Half Marathon, and Marathon times based on current VDOT. Uses `vt()` from `vdot.ts`. Gated on ≥4 weeks of historic TSS data or `stravaHistoryFetched`. Appears before Race Prediction fold.

## 2026-03-05 — Training Readiness TSB Signal Fix (Batch 3.2)

- **Root cause fixed** (`fitness-model.ts`): Cross-trainers were getting permanently negative TSB because the mixed-signal model uses Signal A (runSpec-discounted) for CTL but Signal B (full physiological) for ATL — creating a structural gap that shows as chronic fatigue even at steady state. This is correct for load management but wrong for readiness.
- **`computeSameSignalTSB()`** (`fitness-model.ts`): New exported function. Uses Signal B for both CTL and ATL with the same seed, so steady-state TSB converges near 0. ATL inflation from `acwrOverridden`/`recoveryDebt` still applied. `CTL_DECAY` and `ATL_DECAY` constants exported.
- **Wired in readiness ring** (`home-view.ts`): `buildReadinessRing` and the pill info sheet handler both now compute `tsb` and `ctlNow` from `computeSameSignalTSB` instead of the mixed-signal model. Original metrics still used for `ctlFourWeeksAgo` (momentum signal).
- **Tests** (`fitness-model.test.ts` new, `readiness.test.ts`): 6 new `computeSameSignalTSB` unit tests (null, steady-state, spike, light week, seed, decay constants) + 2 readiness integration tests for cross-trainer scenario. **748 total tests passing**.

## 2026-03-05 — Training Readiness UX Polish (Batch 3.1)

- **ISSUE 1** (`home-view.ts`): Driving signal pill now has coloured left border (`border-left: 3px solid var(--c-warn)`) and "⬇ Main factor" label — user immediately sees which sub-metric is pulling the score down.
- **ISSUE 2** (`home-view.ts`): Each pill (`data-pill="fitness|safety|momentum|recovery"`) is individually tappable. Tap opens a bottom-sheet info sheet with: current value, zone label, plain-English explanation, scale bar with position marker, and "What to do" advice. Event propagation stopped so pill tap doesn't also toggle the card.
- **ISSUE 3** (`home-view.ts`): Removed flawed "second tap = action" behaviour. Ring card now just toggles pills open/closed. When readiness ≤ 59 an "Adjust today's session" button appears inside the pills panel — text varies by driving signal (Swap to easy run / Reduce session load / Take it lighter today / Keep consistency). Button routes to `triggerACWRReduction()`.
- **ISSUE 4** (`home-view.ts`): Momentum pill sub-caption changed from "CTL 195" → "Fitness 195" — no jargon.
- **ISSUE 5** (`home-view.ts`): Deleted `buildSignalBars()` and `buildSparkline()` dead code (~220 lines).
- **ISSUE 6** (`home-view.ts`): Recovery pill value colour now reflects actual score (amber < 65, red < 40) instead of always green.

## 2026-03-05 — Training Readiness Ring + No Jargon cleanup

- **Training Readiness Ring** (`src/calculations/readiness.ts`, `src/ui/home-view.ts`): New composite 0–100 score on the Home page. Four sub-signals: Freshness (TSB), Load Safety (ACWR), Momentum (CTL trend), Recovery (sleep/HRV when available). Safety floor: ACWR > 1.5 caps score ≤ 39, ACWR 1.3–1.5 caps ≤ 59. Labels: Ready to Push / On Track / Manage Load / Ease Back. Ring tap expands sub-metric pills; second tap triggers reduction or Stats. Replaced `buildSignalBars()` + `buildSparkline()`. **26 tests** all passing.
- **Bug fix** (`readiness.ts`): `clamp()` argument order was wrong (`clamp(0, 100, expr)` → always returned 100). Fixed to `clamp(expr, 0, 100)` — sub-scores now computed correctly.
- **No Jargon** (`src/ui/main-view.ts`, `src/ui/stats-view.ts`): Renamed all user-facing jargon per spec. "Injury Risk" → "Load Safety" (plan tab bar + info sheet). "Fitness (CTL)" → "Running Fitness (CTL)". "Fatigue (ATL)" → "Short-Term Load (ATL)". "Form (TSB)" → "Freshness (TSB)". "Fitness, Fatigue & Form" → "Running Fitness, Load & Freshness". "High risk" → "High Risk" (capitalised, injury language removed).
- **Stats page "Your Numbers"** (`src/ui/stats-view.ts`): 5 Garmin-style horizontal position bars added to the "Advanced" section (renamed "Your Numbers"): Running Fitness, Short-Term Load, Freshness, VDOT, Load Safety — each with zone segments and a marker pin.

## 2026-03-05 — Batch 2: load calc, skip logic, cardiac efficiency, injury link, modal copy, km/mi, phases, plan bar, sync button

- **ISSUE-57/42**: `stravaSync.ts` — `fetchStravaHistory` and `backfillStravaHistory` now filter out the current in-progress week before storing to `historicWeeklyTSS` / `historicWeeklyRawTSS` / `historicWeeklyKm` / `historicWeeklyZones`. The edge function always returns the current partial week; storing it caused an off-by-one shift that made Fix 4 in `getChartData` backfill the wrong plan week. Near-zero load for the most recent completed week is now correctly shown.
- **ISSUE-16**: `events.ts` — General fitness / continuous mode second skip now shows "Drop It / Keep It" confirmation dialog instead of silently auto-dropping. Race-time penalty (`s.timp`) only applied in race mode. First skip (push to next week) was already correct in both modes.
- **ISSUE-48**: `events.ts` + `lt-estimator.ts` — Cardiac Efficiency Trend now only records Z2 HR data points (gate added before `recordEfficiencyPoint`). Added >10% improvement significance threshold in `estimateFromEfficiencyTrend()`. This prevents recovery-pace easy runs and aerobic-threshold runs from polluting the trend and causing spurious VDOT decline.
- **ISSUE-09**: `home-view.ts` — ACWR risk caption now identifies and names the top-contributing activity (highest Signal B TSS) from `garminActuals` + `adhocWorkouts`. High/caution captions include top contributor and "Tap to adjust your training plan" CTA.
- **ISSUE-10**: `suggestion-modal.ts` — `acwrHeader` rewrites lead sentence from ACWR ratio to human consequence ("You've been training X% harder than usual"). Titles changed to "Heavy training week" / "Load building up". ACWR ratio preserved in the "See details" panel.
- **ISSUE-31**: `state.ts` + `format.ts` + `account-view.ts` + `home-view.ts` + `stats-view.ts` + `activity-detail.ts` — KM/Mile toggle. Added `unitPref: 'km' | 'mi'` to state, `formatKm()` utility, Preferences card with segmented control in Account. Distance displays updated across all key views.
- **ISSUE-32**: `plan-view.ts` — Phase now shows as a colour-coded badge (Base=blue, Build=orange, Peak=red, Taper=green) in the plan week header next to the date. Added `phaseBadge()` + `PHASE_COLORS` helpers.
- **ISSUE-26/45**: `plan-view.ts` — Replaced "Week load: X TSS planned · Y so far" text with a visual progress bar (accent bar, planned vs actual TSS). Shown for current and future weeks; past weeks retain the TSS badge.
- **ISSUE-27**: Confirmed already resolved — Sync Strava was never in plan-view; it lives correctly in account-view.ts. Marked as done in OPEN_ISSUES.md.

## 2026-03-05 — Bug batch 2: build unblocked, GPS splits, ACWR consistency, recovery bar, TSS dedup

- **ISSUE-64**: Unblocked production build — 42 TS errors → 0. `tsconfig.json` now excludes `src/scripts/` + `src/testing/`. Created `src/vite-env.d.ts` for `import.meta.env` types. Fixed `InjuryType` (`'overuse'` → `'general'`) and `CapacityTestType` (`'walk_10min'` → `'pain_free_walk'`) in test fixtures. Cast renderer's `(w as any).status === 'passed'` to preserve capacity test badge. Added `rateCapacityTest` to `Window` interface. Deleted 60-line unreachable block in `initializing.ts`.
- **ISSUE-65**: GPS per-km splits now work — wired `buildKmSplits()` into simple distance, dist@pace, progressive easy portion, and added `Xkm [description]` catch-all. 5 failing GPS tests → all 714 passing.
- **ISSUE-66**: ACWR `atlSeed` now consistent across all 12 call sites — applied gym-inflation formula to 9 missing sites in `home-view.ts`, `main-view.ts`, `stats-view.ts`, `renderer.ts`, `events.ts`, `activity-review.ts`. Added missing `planStartDate` to `stats-view.ts:428`.
- **ISSUE-67**: Recovery bar direction fixed — was `100 - recoveryPct` (wide = bad), now `recoveryPct` (wide = good).
- **ISSUE-68**: `computeWeekTSS` (Signal A) now deduplicates by `garminId` — prevents double-counting activities in both `garminActuals` and `adhocWorkouts`. Likely root cause of ISSUE-42/57.
- **ISSUE-69**: Suggestion modal ACWR details panel — removed duplicate `display:none` that immediately overrode `display:flex`. Toggle now works correctly.

## 2026-03-05 — Issue batch 1: deload week check-in guard + doc fixes

- **ISSUE-54** (already resolved): Confirmed duplicate "Running Fitness" sections in suggestion modal were removed in 2026-03-04 jargon cleanup. No code change needed.
- **ISSUE-17**: `main-view.ts` + `plan-view.ts` — benchmark panel now returns `''` on deload weeks. Added `isDeloadWeek` + `abilityBandFromVdot` checks to `renderBenchmarkPanel` / `buildBenchmarkPanel`. Hard efforts (threshold, speed, race sim) never presented on recovery/deload weeks.
- **ISSUE-53**: `home-view.ts` — `buildTodayWorkout` and "next workout" finder now apply `wk.workoutMoves` before searching by day. Moving a workout on Plan tab now correctly reflects in Home view today card and upcoming label.
- **ISSUE-23**: Confirmed already fixed — stats chart legend reads "Your running base" (no hardcoded week count).
- **ISSUE-39**: `welcome-back.ts` — `WELCOME_BACK_MIN_HOURS` raised from 20 → 24. Welcome back modal now suppressed if app was opened within the last 24 hours.
- **ISSUE-56**: `stats-view.ts`, `suggestion-modal.ts`, `home-view.ts` — replaced all "reduce one session" copy with load-based language ("shorten or ease remaining sessions", "reducing intensity or duration").
- **ISSUE-24**: `stats-view.ts` + `main-view.ts` — "Building baseline" gate raised from `< 3` to `< 4` weeks. "Calibrating intensity zones" already properly gated.
- **ISSUE-59**: `home-view.ts` — gym session Home card now appends "Gym Session" to name if missing. Exercises (newline-separated in workout `d` field) render as a `<details>` expandable list below the workout title.
- **ISSUE-50** (already present): Load chart footnote confirmed at `stats-view.ts:265`. No code change.

## 2026-03-04 — Stats chart fixes: single area, range slicing, Monday anchoring, near-zero fallback, Signal A running chart

- **Fix 1** `buildLoadHistoryChart`: removed fake aerobic/intensity split (was hardcoded 88%/12% when zone data absent). Replaced with a single clean blue area (`rgba(99,149,255)`). Legend simplified to "Total load (all sports)" + ref line entries only.
- **Fix 2** `getChartData`: range slicing now applied before appending current week — `8w` slices to last 8, `16w` to last 16, `all` unsliced. `histWeekCount` reflects the sliced length.
- **Fix 3** `buildLoadHistoryChart`: week labels now anchored to Monday of the current ISO week. Rightmost label still shows today's date.
- **Fix 4** `getChartData`: for any of the last 4 hist entries where TSS < 5 (Strava edge fn gap), falls back to live `computeWeekRawTSS` from plan data. Fixes near-zero display for Feb 25 week.
- **Fix 5** `buildRunningFitnessChart`: replaced flat CTL-only sparkline with weekly Signal A area chart (green). CTL now a dashed reference line overlay. Caption updated. x-axis uses same Monday-anchor.

## 2026-03-04 — Phase 10: Adjust Week button + carry-over card in plan-view

- `plan-view.ts`: Added `buildAdjustWeekRow()` — context-sensitive button ("Adjust week / Review session changes / Resolve X TSS extra load") shown when `hasPendingExcess || hasUnacceptedTimingMods`. Wired to `triggerExcessLoadAdjustment()`.
- `plan-view.ts`: Added `buildCarryOverCard()` — orange card at top of plan list when `wk.hasCarriedLoad && !wk.carryOverCardDismissed`. Tap → `triggerExcessLoadAdjustment()`; dismiss × → sets `wk.carryOverCardDismissed = true`.
- `persistence.ts`: Sets `currWk.hasCarriedLoad = true` when unresolved load items are carried from previous week.
- `excess-load-card.ts`: Exported `triggerExcessLoadAdjustment` so plan-view can import it directly.
- `home-view.ts`: Removed "Adjust week →" button and its event handler — button now lives exclusively in plan-view. Caption ("You have unresolved cross-training load this week.") retained.
- `types/state.ts`: Added `hasCarriedLoad?: boolean` and `carryOverCardDismissed?: boolean` to `Week` interface (done in previous session).

## 2026-03-04 — Fix: TSS signal consistency (B1/B2/B3/B5/B6)

- **B1** `home-view.ts` `buildProgressBars`: switched `tssActual` from `computeWeekTSS` (Signal A) to `computeWeekRawTSS` (Signal B) — home load bar now shows honest total physiological load per PRINCIPLES.md
- **B2** `stats-view.ts` `getChartData`: 8-week Training Load chart now uses Signal B throughout. Uses `historicWeeklyRawTSS` when available, falls back to `historicWeeklyTSS × 1.4` proxy (PRINCIPLES.md sanctioned). Eliminates false spike caused by stitching Signal A history with Signal B current week.
- **B3** `home-view.ts` `buildSignalBars`: added same `atlSeed` inflator as `buildAdvancedSection` in `stats-view.ts`. Home and Stats now compute ACWR identically — closes ISSUE-55.
- **B5** `plan-view.ts`: switched `_actualTSS` (plan load line) from Signal B to Signal A — both sides of "X planned · Y so far" are now run-equivalent, apples-to-apples.
- **B6** `stats-view.ts`: renamed "Zones" tab to "Running Zones" — makes clear this chart shows run-derived data only (stays Signal A per design).

## 2026-03-04 — Fix: TSS double-count in computeWeekRawTSS (ISSUE-42)

- **Bug fix** `fitness-model.ts` `computeWeekRawTSS()`: added `seenGarminIds` Set to deduplicate
  across all three sources (`garminActuals`, `adhocWorkouts`, `unspentLoadItems`). Previously,
  after a cross-training session was approved via the suggestion modal it landed in `adhocWorkouts`
  AND contributed to `wk.actualTSS`; `computeWeekRawTSS` (called by Stats page and ACWR) would
  then recount it from `adhocWorkouts`, inflating the displayed TSS by ~28–40 TSS for a typical
  tennis/HIIT session. The dedup check strips the `garmin-` prefix from adhoc workout IDs to
  match the raw garminId stored in `garminActuals` and `unspentLoadItems`.

## 2026-03-04 — Phase 8 + 9: Tier 1 auto-reduce + Tier 2 card reframe

- **New** `getWeeklyExcess(wk, baseline, planStartDate)` exported from `fitness-model.ts`:
  Signal B total for the week minus `signalBBaseline`. Returns 0 if no baseline set.
- **Tier 1 auto-reduce** (`activity-review.ts` `autoProcessActivities`): when excess ≤ 15 TSS
  above baseline, the nearest unrated easy run is silently reduced (distance via ~5.5 TSS/km at
  RPE4). Stores `WorkoutMod` with `modReason: "Auto: …"` and `autoReduceNote`. `unspentLoadItems`
  remain in state so undo works.
- **Plan card** (`plan-view.ts`): auto-reduced easy runs show a note row below the card header
  with the reduction summary and an **Undo** button. Undo removes all `Auto:` mods; excess card
  reappears automatically.
- **Tier 2 card** (`excess-load-card.ts`): hidden when Tier 1 `Auto:` mod exists; hidden when
  excess is <15 TSS or >40 TSS (baseline known); label reframed to `"X TSS above your usual
  weekly load"` instead of `"X TSS unspent"`.
- **`WorkoutMod`** interface: added optional `autoReduceNote?: string`.

## 2026-03-04 — Phase 7: Timing check — day-proximity quality session downgrade

- **New** `src/cross-training/timing-check.ts`: `applyTimingDowngradesFromWorkouts()` scans
  each unrated quality session (threshold/vo2/long) and checks if a Signal B ≥ 30 TSS activity
  was completed the day before (dayOfWeek - 1 mod 7). If so, generates a WorkoutMod:
  threshold → marathon pace, vo2 → threshold, long → −15% km (if Signal B ≥ 50 TSS).
  `mergeTimingMods()` integrates with state — generates workouts via `generateWeekWorkouts`,
  replaces old Timing: mods in `wk.workoutMods`, returns true if anything changed.
- **Wired** into `activitySync.ts` and `stravaSync.ts`: `mergeTimingMods()` called after each
  sync, saves state only when mods changed.
- **Plan card** (`plan-view.ts`): amber badge "Adjusted — hard session yesterday" shown on
  affected unrated quality sessions. Expanded detail panel shows explanation + adjusted pace
  label + "Move this session to a different day for full intensity." note.
- Mods are computed fresh every sync — automatically clear when activity or session is rescheduled.
- modReason in `wk.workoutMods` now also patched onto workout object during `getPlanHTML()`.

## 2026-03-04 — Signal B baseline: edge function + state fields

- **Edge function** (`sync-strava-activities`): `history` mode now returns `rawTSS` (Signal B)
  alongside existing `totalTSS` (Signal A). New `getRawFallbackTSS()` computes raw physiological
  load without runSpec discount for no-HR activities. Sport breakdown now includes `rawTSS` and
  `sessionCount` per sport per week. Deployed to `elnuiudfndsvtbfisaje`.
- **State** (`src/types/state.ts`): Added `historicWeeklyRawTSS`, `signalBBaseline`,
  `sportBaselineByType` fields.
- **Client** (`src/data/stravaSync.ts`): `fetchStravaHistory()` now populates all three new
  state fields. `signalBBaseline` = simple 8-week average of raw weekly TSS. `sportBaselineByType`
  = per-sport avg session rawTSS + sessions/week (Phase 2 calibration data, not yet consumed).
  Backward-compatible: `rawTSS ?? totalTSS` fallback if old edge fn cached response used.
- **Closes ISSUE-52** (Signal B edge function gap). ISSUE-51 (v2 rebuild) next.

## 2026-03-04 — Cross-training load management v2 design

- **Design session**: Diagnosed and documented the reduce/replace logic gaps (ISSUE-51, ISSUE-52).
- **PRINCIPLES.md**: Added "Cross-Training Load Management — Excess & Reduction Logic" section
  with three-tier response model, Signal B baseline definition, timing sensitivity rules,
  high-intensity sport handling, quality session independence, and "Adjust Week" UX moment.
- **FEATURES.md**: Added §18b spec for full v2 rebuild — not yet built.
- **OPEN_ISSUES.md**: Added ISSUE-51 (v2 rebuild), ISSUE-52 (Signal B edge function gap).

## 2026-03-04 — VDOT bug fix + history display

- **physioAdj clamp** (`events.ts`): All code paths that set `s.physioAdj` now clamp the value to `Math.max(-5.0, rawAdj)`. A physioAdj below -5.0 is implausible and was causing VDOT to drop 2.5 pts when stale LT data triggered `applyAutoLTUpdate`.
- **`applyAutoLTUpdate` warning log**: Added `console.warn` when the clamp fires so debugging is easier in future.
- **`syncPhysiologySnapshot` LT sanity check** (`physiologySync.ts`): If the Garmin-supplied `lt_pace_sec_km` would imply a VDOT more than 8 pts from `s.v`, it is silently skipped and logged. Prevents stale Garmin LT measurements from corrupting `s.lt`.
- **VDOT history** (`state.ts`, `events.ts`): Added `vdotHistory?: Array<{week, vdot, date}>` to `AppState`. `recordVdotHistory()` helper appended after every VDOT-changing event: `rate()` (when RPE changes VDOT), `applyAutoLTUpdate()`, `updateFitness()`, `recordBenchmark()`, and `next()` (week advance). Capped at last 20 entries.
- **VDOT sparkline + change note** (`stats-view.ts`): `buildFoldedPaces` now shows a SVG sparkline of `vdotHistory` below the VDOT number. Shows colour-coded change note: "↓ X pts since [date]" or "↑ X pts" or "Steady". Helpers: `buildVdotSparkline()`, `buildVdotChangeNote()`.
- **VDOT info button** (`stats-view.ts`): Added `buildInfoIcon('vdot')` next to "Current VDOT" label. Tapping reveals an inline explanation. Added `'vdot'` entry to `INFO_TEXTS`.

---

## 2026-03-03 — Signal A/B round 2: narrative/bar fixes, ATL seed, dual badge

- **Narrative sentence** switched to Signal B (`computeWeekRawTSS`) — drives "should I rest?" decisions, must use raw fatigue not running-equiv
- **"Total Load vs Plan" bar** in Advanced: switched to Signal B, renamed, added "Includes runs, gym & cross-training at full physiological weight" note
- **Load chart current week**: Signal B; historical bars remain Signal A (edge fn deferred); legend footnote explains the mix
- **ATL seed split**: `computeFitnessModel` + `computeACWR` now take optional `atlSeed` param. Callers pass `ctlBaseline × (1 + 0.1 × gymSessions)` capped at 1.3×. Cross-training-heavy athletes start with elevated ACWR from day 1
- **"This Week" card**: sub-label → "vs your running base"; no-baseline label → "total load (runs + gym + sport)"
- **Plan-view badge**: shows `X run · Y total` when Signal B > Signal A × 1.15; `title` tooltip explains both numbers

---

## 2026-03-03 (continued) — Garmin physiology pipeline fixes + all-time Max HR

- **`sync-physiology-snapshot` response shape changed** — now returns `{ days, maxHR }` envelope; `maxHR` is the all-time peak across all `garmin_activities` (Garmin + Strava), not today's daily value.
- **`physiologySync.ts` updated** — `callEdgeFunction` typed as `PhysiologyResponse`; `data.maxHR` applied to `s.maxHR` (replaces per-day `latest.max_hr`); `rows` extracted from `data.days`.
- **Physiology charts: min 3 data points** — `miniChart()` in both `main-view.ts` and `stats-view.ts` now shows "Building history…" until 3+ valid values exist (was 2).

---

## 2026-03-03 — Signal A/B load model split + stats two-chart redesign

- **`computeWeekRawTSS()` added** (`fitness-model.ts`) — Signal B function: same as `computeWeekTSS` but removes `runSpec` discount from adhoc cross-training and unspent load items. Skips `actualTSS` fast-path (stored value is Signal A). Raw iTRIMP for garminActuals unchanged.
- **`computeFitnessModel()` ATL split** — CTL now uses Signal A (run-equivalent, `computeWeekTSS`); ATL now uses Signal B (total physiological, `computeWeekRawTSS`). ACWR ratio = Signal B fatigue / Signal A fitness. Cross-training weeks now correctly raise ACWR.
- **`FitnessMetrics` extended** — added `rawTSS: number` field (Signal B for each week).
- **`strength` runSpec 0.30 → 0.35** (`sports.ts`) — compound leg work has partial but real transfer to running; Signal B (ATL) is unaffected by runSpec.
- **Stats: Running Fitness chart** (`stats-view.ts`) — new `buildRunningFitnessChart()` renders a green CTL sparkline below the summary cards. Shows current CTL value + trend arrow.
- **Stats: This Week card** — switched `currentTSS` to `computeWeekRawTSS` (Signal B — honest total week fatigue).
- **Stats: Advanced labels** — "Fitness (CTL)" → "Running Fitness (CTL)" + sub-label "run-equivalent · 42-day avg"; ATL sub-label "total load · 7-day avg"; updated ⓘ tooltips explaining Signal A/B split.
- **Stats: CTL range card** — new gradient bar (0–120 scale) in Advanced section showing Beginner/Recreational/Trained/Performance/Elite bands with verbal explanation.
- **Stats: Legend rename** — "Aerobic TSS" → "Aerobic (all sports)"; "Anaerobic TSS" → "High intensity".
- **Plan view: week TSS badge** — completed week headers now show a muted `XX TSS` chip (Signal A, run-equivalent). Future weeks show nothing.
- **`docs/PRINCIPLES.md`** — added Initialization Principle section (aerobic base gap, Signal B history gap TODO, conversion framing).
- **`docs/LOAD_MODEL_PLAN.md`** — created tracking document with per-phase status, testing instructions, and deferred items.

---

## 2026-03-03 — Garmin physiology card: all 6 metrics, trend arrows, tap-to-expand graph

- **Physiology card rewritten** (`renderPhysiologyCard` in `main-view.ts`) — now shows all 6 Garmin metrics: Resting HR, Max HR, HRV (RMSSD), VO2max, LT Pace, LT Heart Rate. Each metric conditionally renders only when data is present.
- **Trend arrows** — each metric compares latest value against the 7-day rolling average and shows a coloured ↑/↓ arrow (green = improving, red = declining; direction aware of whether higher is better per metric).
- **Dot sparkline** — existing 7-dot history row kept; dot size encodes relative position in range.
- **Tap-to-expand SVG chart** — each metric row is a `<details>/<summary>` element. Tapping opens an inline SVG polyline chart of the 7-day history with date labels.
- **`PhysiologyDayEntry` extended** (`state.ts`) — added `maxHR`, `ltPace`, `ltHR` fields.
- **History mapping updated** (`physiologySync.ts`) — maps `max_hr`, `lt_pace_sec_km`, `lt_heart_rate` from edge fn response into history entries.
- **`buildFoldedRecovery` updated** (`stats-view.ts`) — adds Max HR, LT Pace, LT HR to the 2-column metrics grid in the stats Recovery & Physiology fold.

---

## 2026-03-03 — Garmin pipeline: critical 401 fix, resolveUserId fallback, LT heart rate wired through

- **Root cause: garmin-webhook returning 401 on every Garmin push** — Supabase edge functions require a JWT by default. Garmin Health API is an external server with no Supabase JWT, so every webhook POST was rejected with 401 before reaching any code. All Garmin data (dailies, sleeps, userMetrics) has been silently dropped. Redeployed `garmin-webhook --no-verify-jwt` to allow unauthenticated POSTs from Garmin's servers.
- **`resolveUserId` fallback** — added `access_token` secondary lookup in case `garmin_user_id` was never stored by auth callback (silent try/catch failure). Now tries stable Garmin user ID first, then OAuth token.
- **LT heart rate wired through** — `physiology_snapshots.lt_heart_rate` was stored by webhook but never queried. Added to `sync-physiology-snapshot` select, `PhysiologyRow` interface, `PhysiologySnapshot` return type, state assignment (`s.ltHR`), and `SimulatorState.ltHR`.

---

## 2026-03-03 — TSS: fix carry-over unspentLoadItems inflating current week load

- **`unspentLoadItems` date attribution fixed** — items carried over from previous weeks (via `loadState` carry-over logic) were being counted in the current week's `computeWeekTSS`, inflating TSS (e.g. 170 shown vs ~30 actual). Added `planStartDate?` param to `computeWeekTSS`, `computeFitnessModel`, and `computeACWR`. When provided, `unspentLoadItems` are filtered to only those whose `date` falls within the week's 7-day window (`planStartDate + (w-1)*7` to `+7`). Carry-over items retain their original dates so they correctly contribute to the week they occurred in. All callers updated to pass `s.planStartDate`.
- **ACWR now correctly elevated by historic overflow** — week 2's overflow load (Tennis, Bouldering, Run) now counts in week 2's TSS → ATL is appropriately elevated going into week 3 → ACWR suggests reducing if needed.

---

## 2026-03-03 — Home view: fix session count, make TSS row tappable

- **Session count bug fixed** — "Sessions" in the "This Week" card was always 0 when activities were synced from Strava/Garmin, because it only counted `wk.rated` entries (RPE ratings). Strava/Garmin sync writes to `wk.garminActuals` and sets `wk.actualTSS` without touching `wk.rated`, causing TSS to be e.g. 131 while sessions showed 0. Fixed: `sessionsDone` now takes the max of synced sessions (`wk.garminActuals` keys + garmin-/strava-prefixed adhocWorkouts) and rated sessions, so whichever source has data wins.
- **TSS row tappable** — "Training Load (TSS)" row in the "This Week" card now navigates to the Stats tab on tap, so users can see the activity breakdown that makes up that number. Added a subtle → arrow indicator.

---

## 2026-03-03 — History mode dedup: fix Garmin+Strava double-counting

- **Double-counted activities fixed** — `history` mode in `sync-strava-activities` was summing both the Garmin webhook row (`garmin_id = "12345"`, no iTRIMP) and the Strava backfill row (`garmin_id = "strava-12345"`, with iTRIMP) for the same physical workout. Added a deduplication pass over the sorted rows: activities with start times within 2 minutes are collapsed into one, keeping the row with iTRIMP (Strava-processed) over the duration-fallback Garmin row. Logs `[History] Deduped N duplicate rows` when overlap is detected. This was inflating the peak week TSS (712 shown vs ~465 expected).

---

## 2026-03-03 — Garmin pipeline fixes: resolveUserId fallback, LT heart rate wired through

- **`resolveUserId` silent-drop bug fixed** — webhook `resolveUserId` only looked up by `garmin_user_id`. If the auth callback's `/user/id` fetch failed (swallowed by try/catch), `garmin_user_id` was never stored → every incoming webhook payload resolved to `null` → all Garmin data silently dropped (webhook still returns 200 to avoid Garmin retries). Added `access_token` fallback: if `garmin_user_id` lookup misses, tries `.eq("access_token", identifier)` so data is matched even without the stable Garmin user ID.
- **LT heart rate wired through** — `physiology_snapshots.lt_heart_rate` (stored by webhook's `handleUserMetrics`) was never queried. Fixed `sync-physiology-snapshot` edge function to select and return it. Added `lt_heart_rate` to `PhysiologyRow` in `physiologySync.ts` and apply to `s.ltHR`. Added `ltHR?: number` to `SimulatorState`.
- **`PhysiologySnapshot` return type updated** — `ltHR: number | null` added alongside existing `vo2`, `restingHR`, `maxHR`, `ltPace`.

---

## 2026-03-03 — Stats chart: Y-axis scale, peak annotation, distance chart range fix; backfill HR rounding fix

- **Y-axis TSS scale** — load history chart now shows TSS value labels (e.g. 100, 200, 300…) as absolute-positioned HTML overlays on the chart. Labels use rounded tick steps based on the max value so they're always legible.
- **Peak week annotation** — the highest-TSS week in the chart now shows its TSS value in orange above the peak (e.g. "465 TSS"). Makes it easy to verify spikes visually.
- **Distance chart respects range** — `buildDistanceAreaChart` now accepts `range` param; when 16w/All is selected in the main range toggle, the distance chart in "Dig deeper" uses `extendedHistoryKm` instead of the 8-week `historicWeeklyKm`. Switching the range also refreshes the distance chart.
- **Backfill HR float bug fixed** — Strava returns `average_heartrate` and `max_heartrate` as floats (e.g. `120.1`) but `garmin_activities.avg_hr/max_hr` are `smallint`. Every backfill upsert for 74 activities was failing with "invalid input syntax for type smallint". Now rounds to `Math.round()` in all three upsert paths (step 6 full-stream, step 7 avg-HR batch, standalone). Edge function deployed.

## 2026-03-03 — Strava history: actual HR zone data for chart accuracy (round 4)

- **History mode uses real HR zone data** — the history mode query now fetches `hr_zones` and uses the actual per-second zone distribution (z1-z5) when available, instead of always estimating from TSS/hr intensity. For activities processed with full Strava HR streams (most runs), the chart now accurately shows exactly how much time was spent in each zone. Falls back to `estimateZoneProfile` for activities that only have avg_heartrate.
- **Debug log enhanced** — zone classification source now shown in `[History:row]` logs as `(hr)` for actual zones or `(est)` for estimated.
- **MOUNTAIN_BIKING type fixes** — `getRunSpec` now correctly returns 0.55 (was falling through to 0.40 generic since "MOUNTAIN_BIKING" doesn't contain "CYCLING" or "RIDE"). `getSportLabel` now returns "cycling" instead of "other". `getDurationFallbackTSS` now 0.40 TSS/min explicitly (same as road cycling).
- **Edge function deployed** (`sync-strava-activities`).

---

## 2026-03-03 — Strava history: diagnostics, zone classification fix, and backfill improvements (round 3)

- **`rawTSS` bug fixed** — history mode crashed with `ReferenceError: rawTSS is not defined` on line 434 due to variable rename during Load System refactor. Every history fetch since that commit was silently failing → chart was stuck on old cached state.
- **All-zero hr_zones no longer blocks re-processing** — activities stored without HR data get `{z1:0,…z5:0}` in DB which is truthy, so they were stuck in `cachedWithZones` forever. Backfill now checks if zone values sum > 0; all-zero → `cachedBasic` so next backfill re-attempts avg_heartrate iTRIMP.
- **Standalone + backfill upserts store `hr_zones: null`** instead of all-zero object when no HR stream is available — prevents future stuck activities.
- **Zone classification uses raw (pre-rs-discount) iTRIMP intensity** — previously, HIIT/Hyrox/climbing showed as aerobic because their rs-discounted equivTSS/hr was < 70. Now `estimateZoneProfile` uses raw iTRIMP TSS/hr so high-intensity cross-training correctly shows orange (anaerobic) bars.
- **`cachedBasic` skip fix** — activities in DB without iTRIMP were permanently skipped on re-backfill; now only skip if `cachedBasic` AND has iTRIMP.
- **`activity_name` saved** — added to standalone and both backfill upserts so iTRIMP calibration can work.
- **Activity type re-upsert in backfill** — new step 8 force-updates `activity_type` + `activity_name` for ALL Strava activities, fixing stale types stored by old edge fn versions (e.g. `CARDIO` → `BACKCOUNTRY_SKIING`).
- **Per-week Strava log** — backfill now logs `[Backfill:strava] Week YYYY-MM-DD: N activities` for every week Strava API returns, enabling direct comparison with DB history to find gaps.
- **Per-activity history log** — history mode logs every activity with type, duration, iTRIMP, equivTSS, zone classification.
- **`backfillStravaHistory` populates extended history** — after a 16-week backfill, `extendedHistoryTSS/Km/Zones` are also populated so the stats "16w" button works immediately without a second round-trip.
- **`historicWeeklyTSS` trimmed to last 8 weeks** after backfill (extended history holds the full 16w).
- **Startup threshold raised** — auto-backfill triggers when `historicWeeklyTSS.length < 8` (was < 3).

---

## 2026-03-03 — Fix silent upsert failures blocking backfill from storing activities

- **Root cause identified** — `activity_name` column included in all `garmin_activities` upserts (standalone + backfill modes) but the DB migration had not been applied to production. Supabase returns an error from upsert but without error checking the code silently incremented the counter and continued, so every backfill "processed" 79 activities without storing any.
- **Fix** — removed `activity_name` from all upserts in both standalone and backfill modes. Added explicit error checking (`const { error } = await supabase.upsert(...)`) with `console.error` so future failures are visible in edge function logs.
- **Calibrate mode guarded** — if the `activity_name` column is missing, calibrate returns `[]` instead of a 500 error.
- **Standalone mode fixed** — also removed `activity_name` from SELECT cache query and single-column backfill update; upsert errors now logged.
- **Edge function deployed** — `sync-strava-activities` redeployed. On next backfill run, activities will actually persist to DB and history will expand beyond 2 weeks.
- **Migration note** — `20260302_activity_name.sql` still needs to be applied via the Supabase Dashboard SQL editor to re-enable calibrate mode. One-liner: `ALTER TABLE garmin_activities ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS activity_name text;`

---

## 2026-03-03 — Strava history backfill: fetch 16 weeks of real HR-based load

- **New edge function `backfill` mode** — fetches all Strava activities for the last 16 weeks (paginated), detects HR monitor usage, fetches full HR streams for most-recent ≤99 uncached activities (staying within Strava's 100 req/15 min limit), uses `avg_heartrate → calculateITrimpFromSummary` for the rest. All results upserted to `garmin_activities`.
- **`backfillStravaHistory(weeks)`** in `stravaSync.ts` — client wrapper that calls `backfill` mode then re-runs `fetchStravaHistory` to refresh state. Idempotent (already-cached activities skipped).
- **Auto-trigger on startup** — `main.ts` now calls `backfillStravaHistory(16)` instead of `fetchStravaHistory(8)` when Strava connected + history not yet fetched.
- **Account view buttons** — "Load History" and "Refresh History" buttons both now call `backfillStravaHistory(16)`. Refresh no longer needs to reset `stravaHistoryFetched` flag.

---

## 2026-03-03 — Load history chart now shows full training timeline (pre-plan history + plan weeks)

- **Full timeline in load chart** — `getChartData` in `stats-view.ts` now includes ALL completed plan weeks (real `garminActuals` data) between the pre-plan Strava history and the current week. Previously the chart skipped plan weeks 1..s.w-2, showing only Strava history + current week.
- **Strava overlap trimmed** — Strava history weeks that fall inside the plan period are stripped (the plan week actuals are more accurate); only genuinely pre-plan Strava weeks are prepended.
- **Distance chart aligned** — `buildDistanceAreaChart` applies the same logic so the distance view also reflects completed plan km.
- **`NON_RUN_KW_CHART` extracted** — moved to module-level constant and shared by `getChartData` / `buildDistanceAreaChart` via a `runKmFromWeek()` helper.

## 2026-03-03 — Chart polish: labels, baseline reliability, 16w "no history" state

- **Home page bar labels readable** — "Sessions / Distance / Training Load (TSS)" labels changed from `text-[10px] color:faint` (invisible on mobile) to `text-[11px] color:muted`
- **CTL reference lines hidden until 4+ weeks** — "Your usual" and "Ease back" lines now only show when `histWeekCount >= 4`; below that a note explains "Baseline builds from week 4 — reference lines will appear then". Prevents misleading tiny-CTL reference lines from a 2-week history.
- **"Your usual" legend shows week count** — label now reads "Your usual (8wk avg)" so users understand what it's based on
- **16w/All shows "no more history" message** — when extended fetch returns same or fewer weeks as the 8w default, chart stays as-is and an inline note shows "X weeks synced so far — more history will appear as you keep training"
- **Zone alignment bug fixed** — `historicWeeklyZones` could be undefined from old state, causing zones array misalignment with TSS array (wrong bar getting coloured). `getChartData` now pads zones to exactly match TSS length with `null` entries; chart uses 88% aerobic fallback for null entries
- **Minimum intensity floor** — aerobic TSS is capped at 88% of total to ensure the orange (anaerobic) layer is always visually detectable, even for easy-only training weeks where zone estimation gives 99% aerobic

---

## 2026-03-03 — Load history chart fixes + distance area chart

- **Chart labels fixed** — all charts (load history, distance, zone) now show real calendar dates computed backwards from today, not plan week offsets. Historic Strava data shows correct calendar weeks.
- **TSS units labelled** — load chart legend now says "Aerobic TSS" / "Anaerobic TSS"
- **Reference lines labelled clearly** — legend now has two separate entries with matching dashed-line icons: "Your usual" (dark dashed) and "Ease back" (amber dashed), replacing the confusing combined label
- **Distance chart → smooth area** — Dig Deeper distance tab converted from bar chart to smooth stacked area chart (same style as load history); shows running km vs plan target reference line; calendar dates on x-axis
- **Zone bar initial state fixed** — Training tab TSS + Volume bars no longer show as solid red blocks on first render; parent background now provides the danger-zone colour and the `flex-1` fill div is removed

---

## 2026-03-02 — Spec gaps addressed + Load History Chart

- **Load History Chart (§12.9)** — stacked area SVG chart on Stats page replacing bar chart; aerobic (base+threshold, blue) / anaerobic (intensity, orange) areas; smooth bezier curves; time range selector (8w / 16w / All) fetches extended history on demand; CTL baseline + ease-back reference lines; dig-deeper accordion now shows distance/zones only
- **`historicWeeklyZones` stored** — `fetchStravaHistory()` now persists zone breakdown (base/threshold/intensity) per week; `fetchExtendedHistory()` added for 16w/52w on-demand fetches
- **Minimum running km floors (§5.6)** — goal-time-scaled weekly floor (sub-3:30 → 35km peak, 3:30–4:30 → 25km, 4:30+ → 18km); linear ramp early→peak; nudge shown in volume bar after 2 consecutive weeks below floor
- **5-rule plain language reduction logic (§8)** — ACWR modal header now picks specific copy based on: consecutive intensity weeks (Rule 4), cross-training cause (Rule 3), km spike (Rule 2), intensity-heavy week (Rule 1), or general load buildup (Rule 5); `ACWRModalContext` extended with `kmSpiked`, `crossTrainingCause`, `consecutiveIntensityWeeks`
- **"Already completed" + "no matching run" modal flows (§6.5)** — `SuggestionPayload` gains `alreadyCompletedMatch` and `noMatchingRun` fields; `buildCrossTrainingPopup` detects these edge cases; modal renders contextual panel with [Apply to next week] / [Log load only] buttons
- **Supabase deployment** — `supabase/migrations/20260302_activity_name.sql` applied; edge function redeployed with `history` / `calibrate` / `standalone` modes all live

---

## 2026-03-02 — Workout card data restoration (post-UX overhaul)

The new plan-view/activity-detail UI dropped several data fields that existed in the old renderer. Restored:

- [x] **TSS badge in Garmin/Strava match banner** — `TSS: XX` shown next to distance/pace/HR; computed from `iTrimp` (HR-based) or falls back to `duration × TL_PER_MIN[rpe]`
- [x] **Planned vs actual load comparison** — two-row bar in expanded card (planned grey bar vs actual green/amber/red bar); replaces the zone-profile bars when actual data exists; planned zone profile shown as fallback
- [x] **km splits sparkline inline** — compact vertical-bar chart in the expanded card below HR zones; bars colour-coded green→amber→red by relative pace, inverted so faster = taller
- [x] **Training effect badges** — aerobic/anaerobic effect (Garmin 1–5 scale) shown as labelled chips ("Maintaining", "Improving", etc.) in both the inline banner and the full-page detail
- [x] **Training Load section on full-page `activity-detail.ts`** — large TSS figure with HR-based/estimated label, planned vs actual bars + diff % when `plannedTSS` is passed from the call site; training effect chips below

---

## 2026-03-02 — ACWR-aware week generation + iTRIMP calibration

- `types/state.ts`: Added `Week.scheduledAcwrStatus?` — stores ACWR status at week-advance time so the generator can be seeded without recomputing
- `ui/events.ts`: `next()` now sets `nextWk.scheduledAcwrStatus` ('high'/'caution') alongside `weekAdjustmentReason`; clears it when ACWR is safe
- `ui/main-view.ts`: All three `generateWeekWorkouts()` calls for the current week now pass `wk.scheduledAcwrStatus` — workouts are actually reduced (not just the banner) when ACWR is elevated
- `supabase/migrations/20260302_activity_name.sql`: Added `activity_name` column to `garmin_activities`
- `supabase/functions/sync-strava-activities/index.ts`: Saves `act.name` (Strava workout title) on upsert; new `calibrate` mode returns individually-labelled running activities for iTRIMP threshold calibration
- `data/stravaSync.ts`: Added `calibrateIntensityThresholds(weeks)` — fetches labelled runs, classifies by name keywords, computes personal easy/tempo TSS/hr thresholds, stores on `s.intensityThresholds`; automatically called (non-blocking) at end of `fetchStravaHistory()`
- `ui/stats-view.ts`: Added `buildCalibrationStatus()` — shows calibration count in Advanced section ("Calibrating…" / "Calibrated from N sessions")

## 2026-03-01 — Recovery Check-In Feature

- `recovery/engine.ts`: Added `rmssdToHrvStatus(rmssd)` — maps RMSSD (ms) to `'balanced'|'low'|'unbalanced'|'strained'`; exported
- `data/physiologySync.ts`: Added `buildRecoveryEntryFromPhysio(physio)` — converts `PhysiologyDayEntry` to `RecoveryEntry`; Garmin stress inverted to readiness
- `main.ts`: Added `checkRecoveryAndPrompt(s)` — called after `syncPhysiologySnapshot(7)` resolves; finds today's physio entry, builds entry + computes status; shows manual check-in if no Garmin data; shows `showRecoveryAdjustModal` if orange/red; respects `lastRecoveryPromptDate` one-per-day guard
- `ui/plan-view.ts`: Replaced 4-option sleep quality modal with 1–10 colour-graded numeric tap UI; `handleRecoveryScoreInput` maps score×10 to sleepScore; history capped at 30; sets `lastRecoveryPromptDate`; `showRecoveryAdjustModal` now exported
- `types/state.ts`: Added `recoveryDebt?: 'orange' | 'red'` to `Week`
- `calculations/fitness-model.ts`: ATL multiplier now stacks `acwrOverridden` (1.15×), orange debt (1.10×), red debt (1.20×) — takes the max
- `ui/home-view.ts`: Recovery row shows HRV status dot (colour from RMSSD), resting HR sub-caption with ↑/↓ vs 7-day avg, "Self-reported" caption when manual entry was made today
- `recovery/engine.test.ts`: Added 2 new `rmssdToHrvStatus` tests (all 17 engine tests passing)

## 2026-03-01 — Home screen: tappable signal bars + injury indicator

**Feature parity audit — changes made:**
- `home-view.ts` `buildSignalBars`: Injury Risk and Recovery rows now have `cursor:pointer` and IDs (`home-injury-risk-row`, `home-recovery-row`)
- When `isInjuryActive()`: Injury Risk row replaced with amber "In Recovery" pill + caption; tap opens `openInjuryModal()`
- When not injured: Injury Risk row (ACWR bar) tap opens `triggerACWRReduction()` (plan softening modal)
- Recovery row tap opens `showRecoveryLogModal()` (sleep quality bottom sheet)
- `triggerACWRReduction` exported from `main-view.ts`; `showRecoveryLogModal` exported from `plan-view.ts`
- `isInjuryActive` imported into `home-view.ts` for injury state check

**Still in Plan tab only (not yet on Home):**
- Morning pain check-in (worse/same/better) — shown when injured
- Capacity test UI (Had Pain / Pain-Free) — on injury test workout cards
- Recovery 7-day dot log panel
- Excess Load card / ACWR zone carry banner

---

## 2026-03-01 — Light/Beige palette conversion: main-view.ts

- Converted all Tailwind dark-palette color classes (`bg-gray-*`, `text-white`, `text-gray-*`, `bg-emerald-*`, `text-emerald-*`, `bg-amber-*`, `bg-red-*`, `bg-blue-*`, etc.) to CSS variable inline styles using the design system (`var(--c-bg)`, `var(--c-surface)`, `var(--c-black)`, `var(--c-muted)`, `var(--c-faint)`, `var(--c-border)`, `var(--c-ok)`, `var(--c-caution)`, `var(--c-warn)`, `var(--c-accent)`)
- Updated: header, week navigator, week progress bars, zone bands, ACWR bar, carry banner, lightened week banner, benchmark panel, recovery pill, recovery log, physiology card, all modals (benchmark entry, recovery input, recovery adjust, runner type, styled confirm, ACWR info sheet, TSS info sheet), spinner overlay, toast
- Dynamic color expressions (injured header, phase labels, pain/canRun indicators) converted from Tailwind class interpolations to inline style interpolations
- `setZoneProgress()` updated to set `style.background` instead of className
- `dots()` helper updated to embed color as inline style; call sites pass CSS color values instead of Tailwind class names
- DOM querySelector fixed: `h3.text-sm.font-medium.text-white` → `h3.text-sm.font-medium` (text-white class removed)
- Zero new TypeScript errors introduced

## 2026-03-01 — Phase C2 + C3: History-informed onboarding & adaptive plan rebuild

**ctlBaseline wiring fix (5 callsites):**
- `renderer.ts`, `events.ts`, `main-view.ts` (3×): pass `s.ctlBaseline ?? undefined` as 4th arg to `computeACWR()` — previously these paths started CTL from 0 even when Strava history was available

**Phase C2 — History-informed onboarding:**
- `stravaSync.ts fetchStravaHistory()`: after computing `ctlBaseline`, derives and sets `s.athleteTier` from CTL ranges (beginner <30 / recreational 30–60 / trained 60–90 / performance 90–120 / high_volume 120+)
- `fitness.ts`: 3rd device option "Strava" added (grid-cols-3); Strava connect card with OAuth button; pre-saves `currentStep: 'strava-history'` before redirect so wizard resumes correctly
- New `src/ui/wizard/steps/strava-history.ts`: wizard step shown after Strava OAuth — loading spinner → history summary (avg TSS/km, detected tier, tier description, plan start km, "Use this" / "Enter manually"); inline tier picker via "Change" link
- `OnboardingStep` type: `'strava-history'` added
- `controller.ts`: `strava-history` added to STEP_ORDER after `fitness`; `nextStep()` and `previousStep()` skip it for non-Strava users
- `wizard/renderer.ts`: `renderStravaHistory` case added
- `state.ts`: `stravaHistoryAccepted?: boolean` added to `SimulatorState`

**Phase C3 — Adaptive plan rebuild:**
- `initialization.ts`: if `s.stravaHistoryAccepted && s.detectedWeeklyKm`, override `s.wkm` (weekly km target) with the detected value at plan init time — plan starts at the athlete's actual training volume instead of a runs/week lookup
- `account-view.ts`: "Training History" card shown when Strava connected; displays avg TSS/week, avg km/week, detected tier; "Rebuild Plan with Strava Data" button runs full re-init, preserves existing garminActuals/ratings, then navigates home; "Refresh History" and "Load History" buttons

## 2026-02-28 — Feature parity: Porting missing features to new tab UX

Restored all interactive features that were orphaned when `renderMainView()` became a one-liner delegate to `renderPlanView()`.

**plan-view.ts:**
- Injury banner + Report/Recover buttons: `buildInjuryBanner()`, `buildInjuryHeaderBtn()` — full-width card with gradient accent, pain level, phase, can-run badge, medical disclaimer for return phases; circular icon in header when healthy
- Morning pain check-in: `buildMorningPainCheck()` — once-per-day card with Worse/Same/Better grid; animated in-place feedback on selection
- Capacity test buttons: "Had Pain" / "Pain-Free!" grid on injury capacity test workout cards
- Recovery status pill: `buildRecoveryPill()` — 4 states (no data, green, low+CTA, already prompted)
- Recovery adjust modal: `showRecoveryAdjustModal()` — bottom-sheet with adjustments (run by feel / downgrade / reduce) for poor sleep; `markRecoveryPrompted()` suppresses re-prompt
- Recovery log panel: `buildRecoveryLogPanel()` — 7-day dot history card (green/amber/orange/red by score); "Log today"/"Update ✓" button
- Benchmark check-in panel: `buildBenchmarkPanel()` — optional fitness check-in on benchmark weeks; Garmin auto-detect; `showBenchmarkEntryModal()` bottom-sheet for manual entry (pace/distance/time)

**account-view.ts:**
- Change Runner Type: "Change" link next to runner type label → `showRunnerTypeModal()` (bottom-sheet picker with 3 types); confirmation dialog when plan already started; `applyRunnerTypeChange()` rebuilds plan via `initializeSimulator()`

**stats-view.ts:**
- VDOT &amp; Paces section: enhanced `buildFoldedPaces()` → "VDOT &amp; Paces" — hero VDOT tile with % change badge + "Started at X" sub-label, inline explainer of what VDOT means, paces grid below

## 2026-02-27 — UX Redesign + Load System UI convergence

**Phase 1 — CTL seeding fix**:
- `computeACWR` + `computeFitnessModel` gain optional `ctlSeed?` param — seeds CTL/ATL from Strava history instead of starting from 0
- All `computeACWR` calls in `home-view.ts` and `stats-view.ts` now pass `s.ctlBaseline`
- `main.ts`: calls `fetchStravaHistory(8)` on startup when Strava connected + history not yet fetched, re-renders home on complete

**Phase 2 — Stats Tab full redesign**:
- Complete rewrite of `stats-view.ts` — light theme CSS vars throughout (no dark Tailwind)
- Above fold: "Your last 8 weeks" heading + narrative sentence (3×3 matrix: direction × ACWR status)
- 8-week Training Load SVG bar chart with zone bands (Optimal green shading, "Ease back" threshold line, dashed "Your usual" baseline)
- Two summary cards: "This Week" (±% vs usual + plain-English copy) + "Distance" (km vs plan)
- "Dig deeper" accordion: chart view switcher (Training Load / Distance / Zones), 3 explainer bullets, 8-week summary row
- "Advanced" accordion (persisted open state): distance + load vs plan bars, CTL/ATL/TSB/ACWR metrics grid, ⓘ tap-to-expand inline explanations, ACWR gradient bar with tier label
- Folded sub-sections (light theme): Race Prediction, Current Paces, Recovery & Physiology, Phase Timeline

**Phase 3 — Home sparkline**:
- `buildSparkline(s)` added to `home-view.ts` — 36px mini 8-bar chart below injury risk bar
- Same zone colouring as Stats chart; baseline dashed line; tap → navigates to Stats tab
- Placeholder "Baseline builds in week 4" when no history

**Phase 4 — Suggestion modal Phase B v3 header**:
- `CrossTrainingModalContext` interface + optional 5th param on `showSuggestionModal`
- When provided: renders sport emoji + name + duration, HR-based load + effort type (Easy/Tempo/Interval from `classifyWorkoutType`), matched run name/km, cardio covered % + running km gap with inline tap-to-expand explanations

## 2026-02-27 — Plan tab overhaul: matching flow, visual hierarchy, card detail

**Matching flow fix (critical)**:
- `isDone` now includes `!!garminAct` — workouts paired via activity review now show as "Logged" (green) instead of "Missed"
- `garminAct` lookup moved before `isDone` calculation throughout `buildWorkoutCards`

**Visual hierarchy**:
- Colour-coded left border stripe: green = Logged/Done, blue = Today, amber = Missed, none = Upcoming
- "Missed" label now amber (`var(--c-caution)`) not grey faint — clearly distinguishable from "Upcoming"
- Status shows "Logged" when matched via Garmin/Strava, "Done" when manually rated
- Name no longer fades on completion (only fades on Skip/Replace)
- Garmin banner in expanded detail uses green background (success) not blue

**Expanded card detail enriched**:
- Route map canvas rendered inline when garminActual has polyline — lazy-loaded on expand
- HR zone bars + legend shown when hrZones available (actual data, not estimate)
- Planned load profile (3 bars: Base/Threshold/Intensity) shown for every workout type
- "Move to day" buttons at bottom — 7 day buttons; active day highlighted blue; fixes Sat/Sun drag issue

**Activity Log**:
- Header now shows "X matched" count and "+Y excess TSS" in amber when unspentLoad > 0

## 2026-02-27 — Activity detail + drag-and-drop restore

- **New `src/ui/activity-detail.ts`**: Full-page activity detail view with stats grid (distance/time/pace/HR/maxHR/calories), HR zone bars + legend, km splits with pace-coloured bars, OSM route map canvas (via `drawPolylineOnCanvas`). Back button returns to plan or home.
- **`strava-detail.ts`**: Exported `drawPolylineOnCanvas` (previously unexported) for use in activity-detail.
- **Plan tab — activity click-through**: Activity Log rows (plan-matched garminActuals) and adhoc garmin rows are now tappable with chevron arrow; the inline actMatchRow sub-row on workout cards is also tappable. All navigate to activity-detail. "View full activity →" link added inside expanded card garmin banner.
- **Plan tab — drag-and-drop**: Workout cards now have `draggable="true"` and `data-day-of-week`. HTML5 DnD handlers wire dragstart/dragover/drop — dropping card A onto card B swaps their days via `wk.workoutMoves`. Day moves applied in `getPlanHTML` before rendering.
- **Home tab — activity click-through**: Recent activity rows backed by garminActuals get `home-act-row` class with `data-workout-key`/`data-week-num`; click navigates to activity-detail. Rows without detail (adhoc) show no chevron and no click.
- **Zero new TS errors** in modified files.

## 2026-02-26 — Plan tab: route back to main-view (restore full functionality)

- **Architecture correction**: Plan tab routes back to `renderMainView()` in all views (home, stats, record, account). `plan-view.ts` is parked — it was a partial reimplementation that lost drag-drop, historic week editing, RPE modals, workout names, strava-detail expansion, skip/makeup logic, ACWR bars, GPS recordings, benchmark UI, and more.
- All 'plan' tab navigations restored to full functionality via main-view
- `plan-view.ts` kept as a future starting point for a proper redesign with complete feature parity

## 2026-02-26 — Plan tab: expandable cards, activity log, font fix

- **Inter font loaded** via Google Fonts preconnect in index.html; removed dark Tailwind override on body tag
- **Workout cards expandable**: tap any row to expand inline detail — shows description, Garmin/Strava sync banner with stats, Mark Done / Skip / Unmark buttons. Chevron rotates on expand.
- **Mark Done / Skip / Unrate** wired directly to `rate()`, `skip()`, `getMutableState()` from events.ts — re-renders plan-view after action (no navigation away)
- **Activity Log section** below workout cards: matched activities (garminActuals), adhoc Garmin activities, pending items banner with count; Review button calls `openActivityReReview()` directly
- **Remove garmin (×)** on both the expanded card banner and activity log rows — calls `removeGarminActivity()`
- **All nav routes to 'plan' tab** updated: home-view, stats-view, record-view, account-view all point to `renderPlanView()`

## 2026-02-26 — Phase 1 & 2 UX Redesign (Home tab + Plan tab)

- **New design system** (`styles.css`): Full CSS custom-property system — cream bg (`#FDFCF7`), Inter font, powder-blue accent (`#4E9FE5`), card/pill radii, progress bars, pills, signal bars, type scale
- **New tab structure** (`tab-bar.ts`): 4 tabs — Home | Plan | Record | Stats; Account moved to header avatar
- **Home tab** (`home-view.ts` NEW): Week progress bars, ACWR injury risk bar, today's workout hero card, race countdown, recent activity, sync actions; geometric SVG art behind workout hero
- **Plan tab** (`plan-view.ts` NEW): Week calendar strip, Vergia-style workout card list, week navigation (< > buttons, keyboard arrows, touch swipe); delegates complex operations (rate/advance) to main-view.ts
- **Wired all views** to route 'plan' tab to `renderPlanView()` instead of `renderMainView()` (`home-view.ts`, `stats-view.ts`, `record-view.ts`, `account-view.ts`)
- **Font/contrast fix**: `--c-muted` `#888` → `#555`, `--c-faint` `0.38` → `0.52` for legibility on web

## 2026-02-26 — Strava HR zone caching (fix rate-limit zone loss)

- **Root cause**: Edge function fetched Strava HR streams for ALL 50 activities on EVERY sync, burning the 100 req/15 min rate limit. Activities later in the batch got `hrZones: null`, which persisted in `garminActuals` and triggered "Zone split estimated — HR stream data unavailable" even though the activity came from Strava.
- **Fix — DB caching**: New `hr_zones jsonb` + `km_splits integer[]` columns in `garmin_activities` (migration `20260226_garmin_activities_zones.sql`). Edge function now does a single bulk `SELECT` of existing rows before the loop; activities that already have `hr_zones` in DB skip the stream fetch entirely and return cached data. Stream is only fetched the **first time** an activity is seen.
- **DB writes optimised**: Upsert only fires when fresh stream data was fetched (`needsUpsert` flag), reducing write amplification on every sync.
- **`stravaSync.ts` patch loop**: Comment clarified — the `!actual.hrZones` guard is intentional and correct; the second sync now returns real zones from DB so the patch fires and fills in activities that missed zones on first sync.

## 2026-02-26 — Synced activities display fixes (round 2)

- **`formatActivityType` missing entries**: Added `WORKOUT: 'Workout'`, `CARDIO: 'Cardio'`, `KICKBOXING`, `ELLIPTICAL`, `STAIRSTEPPER`. Fixes "workout" (lowercase via fallback) showing for Strava activities that were stored with `activity_type = "WORKOUT"`.
- **hrZones + startTime on all GarminActual creation sites**: All 6 sites in `activity-review.ts` (manual review assignments, auto-process for runs/gym/cross) now copy `item.hrZones` and `item.startTime` into `GarminActual`. Fixes "Zone split estimated" showing for cross-training and manually-reviewed activities.
- **`stravaSync.ts` patch loop extended**: Now loops over ALL weeks (not just current week) and also patches `startTime` and `displayName` — so activity labels like "HIIT" update correctly on next sync after edge function redeployment, without requiring the user to delete and re-add.
- **`removeGarminActivity` cross-week search**: Now searches ALL weeks' `garminMatched` to find the activity (not just current week). Fixes cases where a past-week activity's × button silently did nothing. Also correctly filters `adhocWorkouts` by both the adhoc id (`garmin-{id}`) AND the workoutId, so matched plan-slot runs are properly cleaned up.

## 2026-02-26 — Synced activities display fixes

- **Edge function `sport_type`**: `sync-strava-activities` now uses Strava's `sport_type` field first (more specific, e.g. "HIIT") before falling back to `type` ("Workout"). Added mappings for `workout` → `CARDIO`, `pilates`, `boxing`, `elliptical`, `stairstepper`. Fixes HIIT activities showing as "Workout".
- **`hrZones` on `GarminActual`**: `activity-matcher.ts` now copies `row.hrZones` directly into the `GarminActual` when auto-completing a run. Previously hrZones were only patched on a subsequent `stravaSync.ts` resync, causing the "Zone split estimated" message to show even for Strava-connected users after first sync.
- **`startTime` on `GarminActual`**: Added `startTime?: string` to `GarminActual` type (`state.ts`); `activity-matcher.ts` now stores `row.start_time` in matched run actuals for date display.
- **Source badge**: `renderGarminSyncedSection` now derives the activity source from the `garminId` prefix (`strava-` → Strava badge, `apple-` → Apple Watch badge, numeric → Garmin badge) instead of checking `stravaId`. All three activity types (matched, adhoc, pending) now show a source badge.
- **Unified format**: All synced activities (matched plan slots, ad-hoc, pending review) now show: Source badge · Name · Distance · Pace · HR · Date · Calories. Helpers `getActivitySource()`, `sourceBadge()`, `fmtActivityDate()` added in renderer.
- **Adhoc structured data**: `addAdhocWorkout()` and `addAdhocWorkoutFromPending()` now store `garminDistKm`, `garminDurationMin`, `garminAvgHR`, `garminCalories`, `garminAvgPace` as extended properties on the workout object. Name no longer includes "(Garmin)" suffix (replaced by source badge).
- **Zone split message**: Changed "Zone split estimated — connect Strava for HR-accurate data" to "Zone split estimated — HR stream data unavailable" (neutral, accurate for all data sources).

## 2026-02-26 — Strava-first activity sync architecture

- **New data source strategy**: Strava is now always the activity source when connected (regardless of wearable). Garmin/Apple Watch continues as the biometric source (VO2max, LT, HRV, sleep, resting HR). For users without Strava, Garmin webhook remains the activity source.
- **`supabase/functions/sync-strava-activities/index.ts`**: Removed enrich mode entirely. Single standalone path — fetches activity list + HR streams, computes iTRIMP + HR zones + km splits, upserts into `garmin_activities` with `source='strava'`. Fixed `garmin_daily_metrics` → `daily_metrics` table name for physiology lookup (was using wrong table, causing fallback to 55/190 defaults for all iTRIMP calculations).
- **`src/data/stravaSync.ts`**: Removed all enrich mode code. `syncStravaActivities()` now always runs standalone and returns `{ processed: number }`. Patches `hrZones`, `kmSplits`, `polyline` onto `garminActuals` after matching.
- **`src/main.ts`**: Boot sync routing updated — if `s.stravaConnected`, calls Strava for activities + Garmin physio for Garmin wearable users. Garmin-only branch no longer calls Strava enrichment. Strava connected toast updated to "syncing activities".
- **`src/ui/main-view.ts`**: Sync button now shows for all users (not hidden for `wearable === 'strava'`). Label updated: "Sync Strava" / "Sync Garmin" / "Sync Apple Watch" based on `s.stravaConnected` then `s.wearable`. Handler routes to Strava when connected.
- **`src/ui/account-view.ts`**: Sync Now button uses same routing. "Pair Strava HR" section renamed to "Re-sync activities" with orange styling matching Strava brand. Handler uses `{ processed }` return type.
- **`supabase/migrations/20260226_garmin_activities_source.sql`**: Adds nullable `source` text column to `garmin_activities` (needed for Strava standalone upsert).
- **`supabase/migrations/20260226_sleep_and_activity_details.sql`**: Creates `sleep_summaries` and `activity_details` tables (were missing from DB schema, causing 400 errors on physiology sync and lap detail sync).
- **`src/data/activitySync.ts`**: Fixed early return bug — `processPendingCrossTraining()` is now called even when the DB returns 0 rows, so stuck `__pending__` items surface on sync.

## 2026-02-26 — Stats page plain-English rewrite (Volume & Load section)

- **`src/ui/stats-view.ts` `buildLoadVolumeHTML`**: Complete rewrite of the Volume & Load section:
  - Removed confusing week-on-week TL delta badge (`-418`) — replaced with plain-English context ("28% less than last week")
  - "Leg Stress" card now only appears when `impactLoad > 0` — no more "None / Musculoskeletal impact (0 units)"
  - History bar charts: hidden until 4+ completed weeks; labels upgraded from `text-[8px]` to `text-[10px]`; bar values sit above bars not below; note explains what the chart shows
  - PMC redesign ("Training Balance" heading): CTL → "Fitness / 42-day base", ATL → "Fatigue / 7-day load", TSB → "Form / Fresh|Neutral|Fatigued". Plain-English explanation of what each means
  - ACWR section in PMC: taller bar (h-2), "this week vs your baseline" label, "Rest / ▲ safe limit / Overload" axis labels
  - Athlete tier: "Safe load increase: up to X% above your baseline" instead of raw ACWR number
- **`src/ui/main-view.ts`**: Training tab TSS split bar now uses 8-week rolling max as scale anchor — stops the ◆ baseline marker jumping when one outlier week sets a huge scale. Added `computeWeekTSS` import.

## 2026-02-26 — Stats + Training tab UX polish

- **`src/ui/stats-view.ts`**: Reordered stats page — Fitness (PMC) and Load/Volume now appear second/third, before Race Prediction. Previously required scrolling past paces/insights to reach training metrics.
- **`src/ui/stats-view.ts`**: PMC "Building baseline" state when < 4 weeks data — suppresses misleading "Fatigued · TSB -99" label (ATL is naturally high early in training); TSB grid cell shows "—" with a plain-English explanation instead.
- **`src/ui/main-view.ts`**: ◆ Baseline label added to legend row on Training tab TSS split bar — was an unlabelled grey diamond.

## 2026-02-26 — Bug fix: Load chart now updates when navigating weeks

- **`src/ui/main-view.ts`**: `updateViewWeek()` now calls `updateLoadChart({ ...s, w: viewWeek })` after every week change. Previously the TSS split bar, Running Volume bar, zone bars, and load numbers stayed frozen on the week you were on when the page loaded.

## 2026-02-26 — Phase B v2: Override Debt, Volume Bars, Carry Tracking, acwrStatus Wiring

- **`src/types/activities.ts`**: Added `volumeTransfer?: number` and `intermittent?: boolean` to `SportConfig` interface.
- **`src/types/state.ts`**: Added `carriedTSS?` and `acwrOverridden?` to `Week`.
- **`src/constants/sports.ts`**: Added `volumeTransfer` (GPS km credit toward running volume bar) and `intermittent` flag to all `SPORTS_DB` entries. Soccer/rugby: 0.7, extra_run: 1.0, hiking: 0.4, cycling/swimming/padel/tennis: 0.
- **`src/calculations/fitness-model.ts`**: Synthetic ATL debt — when `wk.acwrOverridden` is true, ATL computation uses 1.15× the actual TSS, making ACWR appear elevated even after load returns to normal. CTL stays accurate.
- **`src/ui/events.ts`**: Imported `computeACWR`/`computeWeekTSS` from fitness-model. In `next()`: (1) computes zone carry tracking (stores `wk.carriedTSS` when actual TSS > planned × 1.10, with HR zone breakdown); (2) computes ACWR and sets `weekAdjustmentReason` on the incoming week when elevated.
- **`src/ui/renderer.ts`**: `generateWeekWorkouts()` main render call now receives `acwrStatus` from `computeACWR` — plan engine reduces quality sessions when ACWR is elevated.
- **`src/ui/main-view.ts`** (Volume bars): "This Week" TSS bar now splits running (blue) + cross-training (purple) with a CTL baseline marker (◆). New Running Volume row shows running km (blue) + GPS cross-training km (grey-blue, weighted by `volumeTransfer`), with planned km and baseline marker. "Your cross-training is covering fitness load" nudge when run km is zero but cross-training load is healthy.
- **`src/ui/main-view.ts`** (override debt): "Dismiss" button added next to "Reduce this week" — sets `wk.acwrOverridden = true`. Selecting "Keep" in the reduction modal also sets this flag.
- **`src/ui/main-view.ts`** (over-plan % trigger, §5.2): "Reduce this week" button now appears when actual TSS > ~planned × 1.20 even when ACWR is safe/unknown. Button text changes to describe the over-plan %.
- **`src/ui/main-view.ts`** (injury risk label, §5.3): Escalating label below ACWR bar: Safe=hidden, Caution=Moderate amber, High=High red, 1 override=High + override note, 2+ overrides=Very High/Extreme.
- **`src/ui/main-view.ts`** (carry banner, §5.4): Amber collapsible banner above workouts when prior weeks' `carriedTSS` sums (with CTL decay × 0.85/week) to ≥ 8 TSS. Tap-to-expand shows per-week breakdown with decay factor.

## 2026-02-26 — Phase B: ACWR Injury Risk System

- **`src/calculations/fitness-model.ts`**: Added `computeACWR()`, `AthleteACWR` interface, `AthleteACWRStatus` type, and `TIER_ACWR_CONFIG` table (5 athlete tiers with safe-upper ACWR thresholds and labels).
- **`src/types/state.ts`**: Added `athleteTier?` and `athleteTierOverride?` to `SimulatorState`; `weekAdjustmentReason?` to `Week` (surfaced as a banner when the plan engine lightens a week due to ACWR).
- **`src/workouts/plan_engine.ts`**: Added `acwrStatus?` to `PlanContext`. When `caution`: reduces `maxQuality` by 1 (replaces one hard session with easy). When `high`: reduces by 2 and caps long run at previous week's distance. ACWR note propagated to session `notes` field.
- **`src/workouts/generator.ts`**: Added `acwrStatus?` param (passed through to `planWeekSessions`).
- **`src/ui/suggestion-modal.ts`**: Added `ACWRModalContext` interface and optional 4th param to `showSuggestionModal()`. Renders a collapsible context header at the top of the modal explaining the load spike when ACWR is caution/high.
- **`src/ui/main-view.ts`**: Retired `excess-load-card` (removed import, render call, and `wireExcessLoadCard()`). Added ACWR bar in "This Week" panel (below zone bars) — shows ratio, colour-coded gradient bar with safe-threshold marker, status text. Added "Reduce this week" button (caution/high only) → opens suggestion modal with ACWR context. Added `updateACWRBar()`, `updateLightenedWeekBanner()`, `triggerACWRReduction()`, `showACWRInfoSheet()` functions. Lightened-week banner above workouts when `weekAdjustmentReason` is set.
- **`src/ui/stats-view.ts`**: Expanded PMC section — now shows ACWR ratio (prominent number), colour-coded status, bar with safe-threshold marker, 3-metric grid (CTL/ATL/TSB), athlete tier badge with override indicator.

## 2026-02-26 — Zone Mini-Bars on Cards + Cross-Training Planned Load Fix

- **`src/ui/renderer.ts`** (activity cards): Completed activity cards now show zone mini-bars (Base / Threshold / Intensity) with a number alongside, replacing the single-line `38b · 18t · 4i` shorthand. When no HR zone data (no Strava sync), shows "Estimated" badge inline and a footnote explaining to connect Strava for accurate data.
- **`src/ui/main-view.ts`** (planned load): Cross-training planned workouts (`w.t === 'cross'`) now have `SPORTS_DB[sport].runSpec` applied when computing planned weekly TSS, preventing sports like swimming (runSpec 0.20) or tennis (0.50) from inflating the planned target the same as an equivalent running session. Default runSpec 0.40 used for unknown sports.

## 2026-02-25 — Phase A Fixes: Zone Bars + Card Zones

- **`src/ui/main-view.ts`** (zone bars): Zone bars now show each zone as a % of total actual TSS, not relative to each other. Base bar = 179/369 = 49% wide, etc. Subtitle changed to "Zone distribution of actual TSS". Bars thickened to h-1.5.
- **`src/ui/renderer.ts`** (activity cards): Completed activity cards now show zone breakdown inline with TSS: `TSS: 115 · 80b · 25t · 10i · Strava HR`. Uses real hrZones data when available; falls back to workout type profile. Imported `LOAD_PROFILES` for fallback. Zone labels use shorthand (b/t/i) to fit inline.
- **`src/ui/main-view.ts`** (TSS info sheet): Added explanation that planned TSS for cross-training may exceed actual because the plan doesn't apply a running-specificity discount, whereas Strava HR data does.

## 2026-02-25 — Phase A Fixes: Zone Sum + Over-Plan Display

- **`src/ui/renderer.ts`** (Planned TSS): Fixed zone values not summing to the total — now derives `plannedTSS` as sum of zone parts (base+threshold+intensity) rather than from `loads.total` which had an extra 1.15× anaerobic multiplier applied.
- **`src/ui/main-view.ts`** (TSS bar): Bar still caps at 100% width visually, but now shows a `+X% over plan` label (orange) when actual exceeds plan, and `X% of plan` (grey) when below 80%. Added `stat-load-pct` element to HTML template.

## 2026-02-25 — TSS UX Polish

- **`src/ui/main-view.ts`**: Added `?` button next to "TSS" label → opens bottom sheet explaining TSS, reference points (~55 easy 60min, ~80 threshold, ~100 race), and 3 zones (base/threshold/intensity). Replaced text-only zone labels with visual mini-bars (blue/amber/orange) with numbers on the right — bars scale relative to the largest zone.
- **`src/ui/renderer.ts`**: Replaced "Planned load: X aerobic · Y anaerobic" on unrated workout cards with "Planned TSS: X · base / threshold / intensity" breakdown in TSS-scale values. Imports `LOAD_PER_MIN_BY_INTENSITY` for FCL→TSS conversion.
- **`src/ui/excess-load-card.ts`**: Added `?` button next to leg impact label → opens bottom sheet explaining what leg impact means, which sports cause which level, and what to do about high impact.

## 2026-02-25 — Phase A: TSS Rename + 3-Zone Display

- **`src/types/activities.ts`** (`WorkoutLoad`): Added `base?`, `threshold?`, `intensity?` fields (Z1+Z2 / Z3 / Z4+Z5 split) alongside existing `aerobic`/`anaerobic` (kept for cross-training matcher backward compat).
- **`src/constants/workouts.ts`** (`LOAD_PROFILES`): Added 3-zone fields to every workout type profile (e.g. easy = `{base:0.94, threshold:0.05, intensity:0.01}`).
- **`src/workouts/load.ts`** (`calculateWorkoutLoad`): Now populates `base`, `threshold`, `intensity` fields in returned `WorkoutLoad`.
- **`src/types/state.ts`**: Renamed `actualTL` → `actualTSS` on `Week` interface.
- **`src/calculations/fitness-model.ts`**: Renamed `computeWeekTL` → `computeWeekTSS`; `FitnessMetrics.actualTL` → `actualTSS`; added `computeWeekTL` backward-compat alias; `computeWeekTSS` reads `wk.actualTSS` first, falls back to `wk.actualTL` for migration.
- **`src/calculations/activity-matcher.ts`**: `wk.actualTL` → `wk.actualTSS`.
- **`src/data/stravaSync.ts`**: All `wk.actualTL` → `wk.actualTSS`.
- **`src/ui/activity-review.ts`**: Both `wk3.actualTL` → `wk3.actualTSS`.
- **`src/ui/main-view.ts`**: "Training Load" label → "TSS"; `hw.actualTL` → `hw.actualTSS`; `updateLoadChart()` now computes 3-zone breakdown (actualBase/actualThreshold/actualIntensity) using hrZones data when available, otherwise workout-type profile; replaced aerobic/anaerobic sublabels with "X base · Y threshold · Z intensity" labels; load numbers now use `Math.round()` not `.toFixed(1)`.
- **`src/ui/renderer.ts`**: "Training load: X TL" → "TSS: X" on activity cards.
- **`src/ui/stats-view.ts`**: `computeWeekTL` → `computeWeekTSS` import + call sites.
- **`src/ui/excess-load-card.ts`**: "TL" → "TSS" throughout.

## 2026-02-25 — Unified Load Display (TL everywhere)

- **`src/ui/main-view.ts`**: "Activity Load" renamed "Training Load". `updateLoadChart()` now computes planned/actual in TL units (same scale as individual activity cards). Planned uses `TL_PER_MIN / LOAD_PER_MIN_BY_INTENSITY` scale factor applied to `calculateWorkoutLoad()` output. Actual matched runs use iTRIMP normalisation or `durationSec × TL_PER_MIN[rpe]`, split by workout type via `LOAD_PROFILES`. Unspent cross-training items use `durationMin × TL_PER_MIN[5] × 0.35`. Sublabels show "X aerobic · Y anaerobic" in TL units with explanatory subtitle.
- **`src/ui/excess-load-card.ts`**: Added `itemTL()` helper computing TL as `durationMin × TL_PER_MIN[5] × runSpec`. Card body now shows total TL with explanatory text instead of aerobic/anaerobic bars. Popup shows TL per item instead of per-item bars.

## 2026-02-25 — Load System Audit: hrZones Pipeline + impactLoad + UI Tier Badge

- **`src/types/state.ts`** (`GarminPendingItem`): Added `hrZones?` field so HR zone data can flow from the Garmin edge function through the activity review pipeline.
- **`src/types/activities.ts`** (`CrossActivity`): Added `hrZones?` field so zone data is available when building the suggestion popup.
- **`src/calculations/activity-matcher.ts`** (`GarminActivityRow`): Added optional `hrZones?` field; all 3 `GarminPendingItem` builders now copy `row.hrZones ?? null`.
- **`src/ui/activity-review.ts`** (`buildCombinedActivity`): Aggregates HR zone times (in seconds) across all pending items that have zone data, sets `combined.hrZones`.
- **`src/cross-training/universal-load-types.ts`**: Added `impactLoad: number` to `UniversalLoadResult`; updated `crossActivityToInput()` to convert `hrZones` from `{z1..z5}` (seconds) to `HRZoneData` (minutes).
- **`src/cross-training/universalLoad.ts`**: `getSportConfig()` now returns `impactPerMin`; `computeUniversalLoad()` computes `impactLoad = durationMin × impactPerMin` and includes it in the result.
- **`src/cross-training/suggester.ts`**: `buildCrossTrainingPopup()` now passes `hrZones` (converted) to `computeUniversalLoad()` so Tier B (HR Zones) is reached when zone data is available. `SuggestionPayload` gained `tier`, `aerobicLoad`, `anaerobicLoad`, `impactLoad` fields; `buildCrossTrainingPopup()` returns them.
- **`src/ui/suggestion-modal.ts`**: Shows a data tier badge ("HR Stream" / "Garmin" / "HR Zones" / "Estimated"), aerobic/anaerobic percentage split, and leg impact label (No / Low / Moderate / High) below the main load badge.
- **`src/ui/excess-load-card.ts`**: Added leg impact label computed from `SPORTS_DB[sport].impactPerMin × durationMin` for each unspent item.

## 2026-02-25 — Strava Activity Detail: HR Zones, Km Splits, Route Map

- **`supabase/functions/sync-strava-activities/index.ts`**: Enrich mode now computes and returns HR zones (time in Z1–Z5 using Karvonen/HRR thresholds), km splits for runs (from Strava distance+time stream via linear interpolation), and route polyline (`map.summary_polyline`). Match tolerance widened from ±5 min to ±10 min to catch HIIT and gym sessions. Activity type (`activity_type`) now included in `garmin_activities` query so distance stream is fetched only for runs. Deployed.
- **`src/types/state.ts`** (`GarminActual`): Added `hrZones?`, `kmSplits?`, `polyline?` optional fields.
- **`src/data/stravaSync.ts`**: Enrich client patches `hrZones`, `kmSplits`, `polyline` onto `garminActuals` alongside existing `iTrimp`/`stravaId`. `StravaEnrichResult` interface extended to match new response shape. `strava_id` fallback to `'strava-{garminId}'` ensures badge always shows even with older deployments.
- **`src/ui/renderer.ts`** (`renderGarminSyncedSection`): Each matched activity row is now tap-to-expand. Expanded panel shows: stacked HR zone bar (Z1 blue → Z5 red) with per-zone time legend, km split grid (pace per km in M:SS), and canvas route map. Added `fmtZoneTime()` helper.
- **`src/ui/strava-detail.ts`** *(new)*: `toggleStravaDetail()` expand/collapse handler registered on `window`. Includes Google encoded polyline decoder (no external deps) and canvas renderer that draws the route in purple with green/red start/end dots.
- **`src/main.ts`**: Imports `strava-detail.ts` to register `window.toggleStravaDetail` at app startup.

## 2026-02-25 — Activity Review Loop Fixes (Round 2)

- **`src/ui/activity-review.ts`** (`openActivityReReview`): Snapshots `rated`, `garminActuals`, `garminMatched`, `adhocWorkouts`, and `workoutMods` before undoing pairings. Passes an `onCancel` callback to `showActivityReview` → `showReviewScreen` → Cancel button. Pressing Cancel now restores state exactly as it was before the modal opened — no pairings lost.
- **`src/ui/activity-review.ts`** (`showActivityReview`, `showReviewScreen`): Added optional `onCancel?: () => void` parameter. Cancel button calls `onCancel` if provided, otherwise falls back to `onComplete` (first-time flow unchanged).
- **`src/ui/events.ts`** (`next()`): Fixed "1 workout to do" false positive on complete week. Old logic compared `Object.keys(wk.rated).length` (all rated items including gym/sports) against `s.rw` (configured run days) — incompatible units. New logic generates the actual week workouts upfront, filters to run-type workouts only, and counts those without a `wk.rated` entry. Auto-skip code reuses the same `weekWorkouts`/`unrated` computation.
- **`src/ui/renderer.ts`** (`renderGarminSyncedSection`): Section now stays visible when activities are in `garminPending` with `__pending__` status (user cancelled the review before applying). Pending items render with a yellow/amber "pending review" badge so the Review button in the header remains accessible.

## 2026-02-25 — Activity Review Loop Fixes (Round 1)

- **Root cause found**: `__editThisWeek` (the "Edit this week" amber button on past-week views) was wiping all Garmin state (`garminMatched`, `garminActuals`, `garminPending`). After the reload, `syncActivities()` treated all activities as new, re-queued them as `__pending__`, and immediately fired the activity review — even though everything was already paired.
- **`src/ui/main-view.ts`** (`__editThisWeek`): Simplified to only set `ms.w = viewWeek` and reload. No state is cleared. Existing pairings, ratings, and plan state are fully preserved. The activity review will only fire if there are genuinely unprocessed (`__pending__`) items — not for already-paired activities.
- **`src/calculations/activity-matcher.ts`**: Auto-matched runs are now also pushed to `wk.garminPending` so `openActivityReReview()` can find and un-rate them during a manual re-review.
- **`src/ui/activity-review.ts`**: `populateUnspentLoadItems()` deduplicates by `garminId` — prevents excess load from growing on repeated re-reviews.
- **`src/ui/activity-review.ts`**: `applyReview()` guards against overwriting an already-confirmed match in the run loop — prevents the "workout shows done but not linked to Garmin data" symptom.

## 2026-02-24 (Round 21 — Load System Overhaul: TL, Impact Load, CTL/ATL/TSB)

- **`src/types/state.ts`**: Added `actualTL?: number` and `actualImpactLoad?: number` to `Week` interface (TSS-calibrated training load and musculoskeletal impact stress per week)
- **`src/types/activities.ts`**: Added `tl?: number` and `impactLoad?: number` to `WorkoutLoad`; added `impactPerMin?: number` to `SportConfig`
- **`src/constants/sports.ts`**: Added `TL_PER_MIN` table (RPE 1–10 → TSS-calibrated TL per minute); added `IMPACT_PER_KM` table (run intensity → impact per km); added `impactPerMin` to every `SPORTS_DB` entry; both tables exported
- **`src/calculations/fitness-model.ts`** *(new)*: `computeWeekTL()` — computes weekly TL from `actualTL` (fast path), iTRIMP, or RPE fallback; `computeFitnessModel()` — CTL/ATL/TSB using 42-day/7-day EMA
- **`src/calculations/activity-matcher.ts`**: Fixed `extraRunLoad` bug (raw Garmin TE 0–5 replaced by TSS-calibrated TL accumulation on `wk.actualTL`); removed meaningless `aerobic`/`anaerobic` Garmin TE fields from `addAdhocWorkout`; added `wk.actualImpactLoad` accumulation for matched runs
- **`src/ui/activity-review.ts`**: Added cross-training TL and impact load storage (`wk.actualTL`, `wk.actualImpactLoad`) at both `applyAdjustments` call sites (regular cross-training + overflow handlers)
- **`src/ui/stats-view.ts`**: Replaced `computeWeekLoad` (Garmin TE) with `computeWeekTL`; replaced "Aerobic/Anaerobic TE / 5 max" display with Actual TL / Planned TL / Impact Load; added `buildPMCHTML()` — PMC chart with CTL/ATL/TSB bars; called from `getStatsHTML`
- **`src/ui/main-view.ts`**: Fixed load history chart to use `hw.actualTL ?? hw.extraRunLoad ?? 0` (correct scale for new data, graceful fallback for historical weeks)

## 2026-02-24 (Round 20 — Strava OAuth integration end-to-end)

- **`supabase/config.toml`**: Added `verify_jwt = false` for `strava-auth-start`, `strava-auth-callback`, `sync-physiology-snapshot`, `sync-activities`, `sync-activity-details`, `sync-strava-activities` — required because Supabase project uses ES256 JWT signing which the edge function gateway cannot verify with HS256; functions do their own auth via `auth.getUser()`
- **`supabase/functions/strava-auth-start/index.ts`**: Strip trailing slash from `SUPABASE_URL`; use `STRAVA_CALLBACK_URL` env var for redirect_uri with fallback
- **`supabase/functions/strava-auth-callback/index.ts`**: Same redirect_uri fix for token exchange
- **`src/data/supabaseClient.ts`**: Fixed `getValidSession()` to check `expires_at` before returning cached session — previously returned expired tokens without refreshing
- **`supabase/migrations/20260224_strava_oauth.sql`**: Ran via SQL Editor — created `strava_auth_requests`, `strava_tokens` tables and added `itrimp` column to `garmin_activities`
- **Deployed**: `strava-auth-start`, `strava-auth-callback`, `sync-strava-activities`, `sync-activity-details`, `sync-physiology-snapshot`, `sync-activities` all deployed to production

## 2026-02-24 (Round 19 — Fix week navigation resetting to current week)

- **`src/ui/main-view.ts`**: Added module-level `_persistedViewWeek` so the viewed week survives `renderMainView()` re-renders; `wireEventHandlers` now initialises `viewWeek` from the persisted value and saves it on every navigation; `updateViewWeek(viewWeek)` at end of `wireEventHandlers` replaces the separate `render()` call in `renderMainView`; `setOnWeekAdvance` clears `_persistedViewWeek` so a real week advance returns to the new current week

## 2026-02-24 (Round 18 — RPE only for runs)

- **`src/ui/renderer.ts`**: Non-running workouts (cross, strength, rest, gym) now show a simple "Mark as done" / "Unmark as done" button instead of an RPE 1-10 grid; RPE badge removed from their card headers; "Done" badge shows no RPE number; running workouts unchanged; `isRunWorkout` flag added alongside `isCompleteRest`

## 2026-02-24 (Round 17 — Planned/Completed workout split + GPS load fix)

- **`src/gps/recording-handler.ts`**: Fixed `createActivity('run', ...)` → `createActivity('extra_run', ...)` so impromptu GPS runs correctly route through SPORTS_DB load pipeline
- **`src/ui/renderer.ts`**: Split workout list into "This Week's Plan" (unrated) and "Completed" (rated) sections; completed Quick Runs move from Just Run banner into Completed section; `renderWorkoutList` no longer injects its own `<h4>` header; GPS recordings div moved to call site to avoid duplication

## 2026-02-24 (Round 16 — Strava onboarding + iTRIMP plumbing)

- **`src/types/onboarding.ts`**: Extended `watchType` union to include `'strava'`; added `biologicalSex?: 'male' | 'female' | 'prefer_not_to_say'`
- **`src/types/state.ts`**: `GarminPendingItem` — added `iTrimp?: number | null`; `SimulatorState.biologicalSex` union extended to include `'prefer_not_to_say'`
- **`src/types/activities.ts`**: `CrossActivity` — added `iTrimp?: number | null`
- **`src/cross-training/activities.ts`**: `createActivity()` — added optional `iTrimp` parameter; spreads onto returned object
- **`src/ui/wizard/steps/fitness.ts`**: Added Strava as a third device picker option (3-col grid); wires `watch-strava` click handler; checks `isStravaConnected()` for connection badge; `btn-wizard-strava` triggers `strava-auth-start` OAuth flow
- **`src/ui/wizard/steps/physiology.ts`**: Added biological sex selector (Male / Female / Prefer not to say) at top; Strava users see connection status + connect button; Garmin users see a "Connect Strava for better load data" nudge banner
- **`src/state/initialization.ts`**: Maps `onboarding.biologicalSex` → `s.biologicalSex`
- **`src/calculations/activity-matcher.ts`**: `GarminActivityRow` — added `iTrimp?`; both pending item builders copy `row.iTrimp`
- **`src/cross-training/universal-load-types.ts`**: `crossActivityToInput()` — maps `act.iTrimp` → `ActivityInput.iTrimp`
- **`src/cross-training/suggester.ts`**: `buildCrossTrainingPopup()` — passes `iTrimp: activity.iTrimp` to `computeUniversalLoad()`
- **`src/ui/activity-review.ts`**: `buildCombinedActivity()` — sums iTRIMP across pending items; passes to `createActivity()`
- **`src/data/stravaSync.ts`**: Passes `biological_sex: s.biologicalSex` in both standalone and enrich mode calls

---

## 2026-02-24 — Impromptu GPS run: match + load pipeline

- **`src/gps/recording-handler.ts`**: Impromptu runs (no name match) now go through a two-stage flow instead of just saving an adhoc entry.
  1. **Smarter match**: `findMatchingWorkout()` is called with the run's actual distance + day-of-week against unrated, non-replaced planned runs. If a match is found, a confirmation dialog ("Assign to [Workout Name]?") lets the user assign it — calling `rate()` on that planned workout.
  2. **Load logic fallback**: If no match or the user declines, the run is saved as an adhoc entry and `createActivity('run', ...)` is run through `buildCrossTrainingPopup` + `showSuggestionModal` so the extra load can adjust the week's plan (reduce/replace/keep).
  - `modReason` for GPS-sourced mods uses `GPS: ${workoutName}` prefix.

---

## 2026-02-24 — Physiology wizard step split

### Refactor: Split fitness step into Garmin connect + physiology data pages
- `src/types/onboarding.ts`: added `'physiology'` to `OnboardingStep`
- `src/ui/wizard/controller.ts`: inserted `'physiology'` between `fitness` and `initializing` in `STEP_ORDER`
- `src/ui/wizard/steps/fitness.ts`: stripped LT/VO2/HR fields; "No watch" now calls `goToStep('initializing')` to skip physiology; "Continue" just persists wearable and advances
- `src/ui/wizard/steps/physiology.ts` (new): LT pace, VO2 max, Resting HR, Max HR fields; "Sync from Garmin" button calls `isGarminConnected()` + `syncPhysiologySnapshot(1)` and populates fields with result count feedback; "Skip for now" advances without saving; "Continue" validates and saves
- `src/ui/wizard/renderer.ts`: registered `renderPhysiology` for the new step

---

## 2026-02-24 (Bug fix — Edit Settings return button)

- **`src/ui/wizard/steps/assessment.ts`**: Added "← Return to my plan" button on the assessment step when accessed mid-plan via "Edit Settings". Detects `isMidPlan` via `getState().wks.length > 0`. Button restores `hasCompletedOnboarding = true` and navigates directly to `renderMainView()` without touching the plan. Back button hidden in mid-plan mode (irrelevant to navigate further back into the wizard). Button appears in all three assessment layouts: non-event, forecast-only, and plan-selection.

---

## 2026-02-24 (Round 15 — Strava + iTRIMP)

### Feature: Strava Integration + iTRIMP Training Load

- **`src/calculations/trimp.ts`** (new): Pure iTRIMP math module — three tiers: `calculateITrimp` (1-second HR stream), `calculateITrimpFromLaps` (per-lap avgHR), `calculateITrimpFromSummary` (single avgHR). β = 1.92 (male/unknown) | 1.67 (female). 20 unit tests all passing.
- **`supabase/migrations/20260224_strava_oauth.sql`** (new): `strava_auth_requests`, `strava_tokens` tables with RLS. `ALTER TABLE garmin_activities ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS itrimp float`.
- **`supabase/functions/strava-auth-start/`** (new): Mirrors `garmin-auth-start`. Initiates Strava OAuth2 PKCE flow; stores ephemeral state in `strava_auth_requests`.
- **`supabase/functions/strava-auth-callback/`** (new): Exchanges code for Strava tokens, stores in `strava_tokens`, redirects to app with `?strava=connected`.
- **`supabase/functions/sync-strava-activities/`** (new): Handles `standalone` (fetches activities + HR streams → `garmin_activities` upsert) and `enrich` (matches existing activities by start_time ±5 min → updates `itrimp` column). Includes inline token refresh.
- **`src/data/stravaSync.ts`** (new): Client-side orchestration. Standalone mode feeds into `matchAndAutoComplete()` pipeline. Enrich mode patches `wk.garminActuals[].iTrimp`.
- **`src/data/supabaseClient.ts`**: Added `isStravaConnected()` and `resetStravaCache()` following the Garmin pattern.
- **`src/types/state.ts`**: `wearable` now includes `'strava'`. Added `biologicalSex?: 'male' | 'female'`. Added `GarminActual.iTrimp?: number | null`.
- **`src/cross-training/universal-load-types.ts`**: Added `iTrimp` field to `ActivityInput`. Extended `DataTier` with `'itrimp'`.
- **`src/cross-training/universalLoad.ts`**: Added **Tier A+** — iTRIMP fires before Garmin Training Effect when `input.iTrimp > 0`. Confidence: 0.95.
- **`src/main.ts`**: Added `wearable === 'strava'` sync branch; Garmin+Strava enrich branch (fire-and-forget); `?strava=connected` redirect handler with toast + account nav.
- **`src/ui/account-view.ts`**: Strava standalone card, Strava HR enrichment card (connect/disconnect/sync), biological sex selector.

## 2026-02-24 (Round 14d)

### Fix: GPS runs now enter the plan + completedKm uses actual distances (`src/gps/recording-handler.ts`, `src/ui/events.ts`)

- **Unmatched GPS runs** (e.g. "Just Run", or any run whose name doesn't match a scheduled workout): now added to `wk.adhocWorkouts` on save, linked via `wk.gpsRecordings`, and `rate()` is called (expected RPE 5, type easy). The run is visible on the training week card with a "View Run" button and counts toward adherence and VDOT feedback.
- **completedKm now uses GPS actual distance**: the week-advance loop checks `wk.gpsRecordings[workoutId]` → `loadGpsRecording()` → `recording.totalDistance` before falling back to the planned description distance. Garmin actuals still take priority.
- **Adhoc workouts counted in completedKm**: the week-advance loop now also iterates `wk.adhocWorkouts` (excluding Garmin-sourced entries), so GPS-only runs contribute to the week's km total.

---

## 2026-02-24 (Round 14c)

### Fix: GPS completion modal always shows + discard confirmation (`src/gps/tracker.ts`, `src/ui/gps-events.ts`, `src/gps/recording-handler.ts`, `src/ui/gps-completion-modal.ts`)

- **Timer fix**: `startTime` is now set in `GpsTracker.start()` immediately after GPS permission is granted, not when the first accurate GPS point arrives. Previously the timer showed 00:00 indefinitely on desktop/web (where location accuracy is typically >30m, failing the threshold), and on slow GPS lock. Now the elapsed counter ticks from the moment the user presses Run.
- **Save modal fix**: `stopTracking()` now shows the completion modal/save option when `elapsed > 5s`, even if `totalDistance = 0` (GPS never locked). Previously any run with <10m of tracked distance was silently discarded with no feedback.
- **recording-handler.ts**: No longer bails silently when no matching scheduled workout is found. Now passes `workout: null` to the modal — which shows "Save Run" instead of "Complete Workout" and skips the planned-vs-actual section. Run is still saved to GPS recordings.
- **gps-completion-modal.ts**: `CompletionData.workout` is now nullable. Button row is rendered dynamically via `showMainButtons()` with a shared `currentSaveBtn` reference so RPE selection correctly enables the save button even after returning from discard confirmation.
- **Discard confirmation**: Clicking "Discard" now shows an inline "This run won't be saved. Are you sure?" prompt with "Keep" / "Yes, Discard" — no accidental data loss.

---

## 2026-02-24 (Round 14b)

### Fix + UX: Interval live UI — parsing + phase visibility (`src/gps/split-scheme.ts`, `src/ui/record-view.ts`)

**split-scheme.ts:**
- `resolvePace(zone, paces)`: resolves literal `m:ss/km` pace strings (e.g. `4:49/km`) as well as zone names; used throughout scheme builders.
- `timeIntervalMatch` regex now tolerates optional `(~dist)` parenthetical between zone and rest: correctly parses `"6×2min @ 4:49/km (~790m), 2 min recovery between sets"` → 6 Rep + 5 Recovery segments.
- New `contTimeMatch` handler for `"Nmin @ pace/zone (~dist)"` (continuous threshold/VO2/MP blocks without reps) → single segment.
- `buildTimeIntervalScheme` uses `resolvePace` instead of `getPaceForZone` → handles literal paces from `intentToWorkout`.
- `distAtPaceMatch` updated to `[\w\-:./]+` zone group (tolerates literal paces).

**record-view.ts — Interval UI redesign:**
- **Phase badge** (`rec-phase-badge`) top-right of header: WARM UP (amber) / INTERVAL (blue) / RECOVERY (gray) / COOL DOWN (emerald) / TEMPO (orange); updates on every segment change.
- **Current segment block** moved ABOVE the segment list: label + remaining distance (large) + target pace / "jog / recover".
- **Segment list** now fills remaining flex space (`flex-1 min-h-0`) so it's always fully visible — no fixed max-height.

---

## 2026-02-24 (Round 14)

### Feature: "Edit this week" plan mode in Training tab (`src/ui/main-view.ts`)
- When viewing a past week via the week slider/arrows, the viewing indicator now shows an **"Edit this week"** button
- Clicking it permanently sets `s.w` to the viewed week, clears that week's `garminMatched`/`garminActuals`/`garminPending` and garmin-sourced `adhocWorkouts`, then reloads
- On reload, Garmin sync treats that week as current → activities queue in `garminPending` → review modal fires as normal
- Button wired via `window.__editThisWeek` closure, updated each time `updateViewWeek()` runs

---

## 2026-02-24 (Round 13)

### Fix: Supabase data pipeline — VO2max, LT, max HR not flowing through
- **`garmin_tokens` migration** (`20260219_garmin_oauth2.sql`): added `garmin_user_id text UNIQUE` column + index — without it, `resolveUserId()` in the webhook returns null for every user and nothing gets stored
- **New migration** `20260224_physiology_and_maxhr.sql`: creates `physiology_snapshots` table (LT + VO2max running), adds `max_hr int` column to `daily_metrics`, backfills `garmin_user_id` for existing installs
- **garmin-webhook**: added `handleUserMetrics()` — handles Garmin `userMetrics` push which carries `lactateThresholdSpeed` (m/s → converted to sec/km) and `vo2MaxRunning`; also added `max_hr` to `handleDailies` upsert
- **sync-physiology-snapshot edge function**: now selects and returns `max_hr` from `daily_metrics` so `physiologySync.ts` can update `s.maxHR`

---

## 2026-02-24 (Round 12)

### Feature: Re-review previous week button in Account → Recover Plan (`src/ui/account-view.ts`)
- New "Re-review Week N-1 Activities" button appears inside the Recover Plan card when `s.w > 1`
- Clears the previous week's `garminMatched`, `garminActuals`, `garminPending`, and Garmin-sourced `adhocWorkouts` + run ratings
- Steps `s.w` back by 1 so the re-sync treats that week as current — activities queue into `garminPending` for the normal review modal instead of being silently auto-processed
- After reviewing, user taps "Complete Week" to advance back to the current week

---

## 2026-02-24 (Round 11)

### Fix: Garmin wizard — connected state + auto-populate (`src/ui/wizard/steps/fitness.ts`, `src/data/physiologySync.ts`)
- "Connect Garmin" button now checks `isGarminConnected()` on mount; shows "✓ Garmin Connected" green badge once connected (no more loop)
- After connection detected, calls `syncPhysiologySnapshot(1)` and copies VO2, resting HR, max HR, LT pace into wizard form fields automatically
- `physiologySync.ts`: LT pace (`lt_pace_sec_km`) from Garmin now wired to `s.lt` (was fetched but silently dropped)

---

## 2026-02-24 (Round 10b)

### Feature: Record tab — phased bar UI for tempo/progressive runs (`src/ui/record-view.ts`, `src/gps/split-scheme.ts`)
- **Three distinct live UIs** now based on workout structure:
  - **Simple** — single-pace run (easy, long, freerun): unchanged
  - **Phased** — multiple named phases, no recovery gaps (WU + tempo + CD, progressive): segmented horizontal bar showing all phases proportionally; current phase fills as you run; colour: emerald (done) / blue (current) / gray (upcoming); labels below bar. Current phase block + 4-stat row below.
  - **Interval** — has null-pace recovery segments: full scrollable segment list (unchanged)
- `isPhasedWorkout(scheme)` helper: true when scheme has multiple distinct non-null paces and no null-pace segments.
- `distAtPaceMatch` and `simpleDistMatch` in `buildSingleLineScheme` now produce a **single segment** (not km-by-km) so the tempo middle block appears as one bar, not 13 tiny slices.
- `patchPhasedStats`: updates elapsed/dist/pace/avg + inner phase fill width every tick; triggers full `renderRecordView()` re-render on phase completion (rare, cheap).
- Phase bar short labels: "Warm Up" → "WU", "Cool Down" → "CD", "Easy" stripped for compactness.

---

## 2026-02-24 (Round 10)

### Feature: Pending Activities card + Review Now button (`src/ui/account-view.ts`)
- New blue card in Account tab appears when `wk.garminPending` has unprocessed items (hidden otherwise)
- Lists up to 5 pending activities (type, duration, distance, date) with "+N more" overflow
- "Review Now" button: navigates to Training tab then calls `processPendingCrossTraining()` with 150ms delay, re-opening the full activity review modal
- Fixes "accidentally dismissed review modal" — no need for a full re-sync

---

## 2026-02-24 (Round 9)

### Fix: Plan weeks always start on Monday
- `src/state/initialization.ts`: `planStartDate` now set to `getMondayOf(today)` instead of today's raw date
- `src/state/persistence.ts`: `getMondayOf` exported; `loadState` snaps any existing non-Monday `planStartDate` to Monday on load (one-time migration for existing users)

---

## 2026-02-24 (Round 8)

### Rename: "Generic Sport" → "General Sport"
- Updated display label in `src/constants/sports.ts` (`generic_sport` key)
- Updated all UI references: renderer.ts dropdown, events.ts slot-matching logic and log messages, wizard steps (frequency.ts, volume.ts)
- Internal key `generic_sport` unchanged

---

## 2026-02-24 (Round 7)

### Feature: Plan Recovery card in Account tab (`src/ui/account-view.ts`)
- New amber "Recover Plan" card always visible in the Account tab
- Date picker for original plan start date (pre-filled with a sensible guess based on current week)
- Week number input (pre-filled with current `s.w`)
- On "Restore & Re-sync": sets `planStartDate`, `s.w`, `hasCompletedOnboarding = true`; clears `garminMatched`/`garminActuals`/`garminPending` across all weeks so the next Garmin sync re-processes all activities from the last 28 days
- Page reloads automatically after 800ms; sync fires on boot as normal

### Bug fix: Edit Settings resets plan (`src/ui/events.ts`, `src/ui/wizard/steps/assessment.ts`, `src/ui/wizard/renderer.ts`)
- **Root cause**: `hasCompletedOnboarding` was never set to `true` in the current wizard flow (assessment → main-view path never calls `completeOnboarding()`). So the `isMidPlan` guard in assessment.ts evaluated as `false` even for mid-plan users, allowing `initializeSimulator()` to fire on "Harder Plan" click.
- **`editSettings()` fix**: now also sets `hasCompletedOnboarding = false` so that on reload, `initWizard()` correctly routes to the assessment step (instead of `renderMainView()` bypassing the wizard).
- **`isMidPlan` guard fix** (`assessment.ts`): changed from `currentState.hasCompletedOnboarding && currentState.w > 1` to just `currentState.w > 1` — the week counter is the reliable mid-plan indicator.
- **Mid-plan "Harder Plan" path**: when `isMidPlan`, only updates `s.rw` in-place (no `initializeSimulator` call), preserving all progress.
- **`transitionToMainView()` fix** (`wizard/renderer.ts`): now sets `hasCompletedOnboarding = true` before rendering main view, so future reloads correctly bypass the wizard and `detectMissedWeeks()` works.

---

## 2026-02-24 (Round 6b)

### Bug fix: Split scheme multi-line / WU+CD / progressive segment grouping (`src/gps/split-scheme.ts`)
- **Root cause**: Multi-line workout descriptions (WU + main set + CD) fell through all regexes to `anyDistMatch`, grabbed the first `Xkm` (WU distance), called `buildKmSplits` with `null` pace → two 1km segments with null targetPace → wrongly shown as Structured UI with "km 1 (recovery), km 2 (recovery)".
- **Fix**: `buildSplitScheme` detects `\n` and delegates to `buildMultiLineScheme`: extracts WU (`Xkm warm up …`) and CD (`Xkm cool down …`) as single labeled segments at easy pace; finds the main set line and parses it with `buildSingleLineScheme`; assembles `[WU] + [mainSet] + [CD]`.
- **Progressive fix**: easy portion is now one `"Xkm Easy"` segment instead of km-by-km splits. Fast portion still km-by-km.
- `buildSingleLineScheme` extracted as a named helper for reuse by `buildMultiLineScheme`.
- `timeIntervalMatch` regex zone group broadened to `[\w\-:./]+` to tolerate literal pace strings like `3:47/km`.

---

## 2026-02-24 (Round 6)

### Redesign: Record tab live run UI v2 (`src/ui/record-view.ts`)
- Added `isStructuredWorkout(scheme)` helper: returns true if any segment has `targetPace === null` (recovery) or segments have more than one distinct target pace; easy/long runs with uniform km splits now correctly use Simple UI.
- **Simple UI**: REC dot + workout name, target pace context line, large elapsed time, progress bar with "X.XX / Y.YY km" label (when total distance known), current/avg pace row, Pause + Stop.
- **Structured UI**: header with workout name + "Seg N/T" counter; full scrollable segment list (`rec-segment-list`, `overflow-y-auto max-h-52`); density adapts (≤6 segments → spacious two-line rows, >6 → compact single-line rows); icons ✓ emerald / ● blue / · gray; current row highlighted with blue bg. Current segment block shows remaining distance (large) + target pace. 4-column stats row (elapsed | km total | pace | avg). Pause + Stop.
- `lastCompletedIdx` module var resets to -1 on each `renderRecordView()`; `patchStructuredStats` auto-scrolls current row into view when a split completes.
- `patchSimpleStats` now also updates `rec-progress` bar width on each tick.
- Removed old 4-segment sliding-window strip (`renderSegmentStrip` / `patchStructuredStats` windowed re-render).

---

## 2026-02-24 (Round 5)

### Feature: Record tab live run UI + universal Track Run navigation (`src/ui/record-view.ts`, `src/ui/gps-events.ts`)
- Every "Track Run" button (plan workout cards, Just Run, Record tab Start Run) now navigates to the Record tab instead of staying on the Plan tab with inline GPS.
- `window.trackWorkout` dynamically imports and calls `renderRecordView()` after `startTracking()` completes.
- Added `activeScheme` module var in `gps-events.ts` to store the built split scheme; exported via `getActiveSplitScheme()`.
- Added `setOnTrackingTick()` / `onTrackingTickCb` — called every second by the timer interval so the Record tab can patch its own DOM without full re-renders.
- Record tab renders two distinct live layouts: **Simple** (large time + 4-stat grid) for unstructured runs, **Structured** (segment flow strip + elapsed/distance/pace) for interval/threshold/progressive workouts.
- Segment flow strip shows a sliding window of 4 segments: ✓ done, ● current with km-remaining and target pace, · upcoming.
- Tick handler is deregistered (`setOnTrackingTick(null)`) when the user navigates away from the Record tab, preventing stale DOM writes.

---

## 2026-02-24 (Round 4)

### Removed Training Log UI panel (`src/ui/main-view.ts`, `src/ui/renderer.ts`)
- The "Training Log" card was an in-memory debug console (cleared on every reload) showing internal Garmin sync messages. All useful information is now visible in the "Synced from Garmin" section and plan workout cards. `log()` now writes to `console.log` for dev tools debugging.

### Bug fix: "Synced from Garmin" section shows clean run names, hides ugly IDs and non-run activities (`src/ui/renderer.ts`, `src/ui/activity-review.ts`, `src/types/state.ts`)
- Added `workoutName` field to `GarminActual` and populated it at run match write sites with the human-readable slot name (e.g. "Easy Run", "Long Run").
- Section now shows matched runs using `workoutName` (e.g. "Easy Run · 7.3 km · 5:12/km · HR 142") instead of the internal ID ("W1-easy-0").
- Cross-training and gym matched activities are filtered out of the section — they are already visible as modified plan slots above. Only run-type matched and adhoc entries appear.
- "Synced from Garmin" section now shows for any week with matched or unmatched Garmin runs.

### Bug fix: "Synced from Garmin" section now shows matched plan activities too (`src/ui/renderer.ts`)
- Previously the section only showed adhoc (unmatched) activities with `garmin-` id prefix. Activities matched to plan slots went into `garminActuals` and were invisible in the log. Now both matched (showing workout name, distance, pace, HR, "matched" badge) and unmatched (with RPE + remove button) appear. The section shows for any week that has either.

### Bug fix: Km stats now show run-only distances and correct weekly scope (`src/state/persistence.ts`, `src/ui/renderer.ts`, `src/ui/stats-view.ts`, `src/ui/main-view.ts`)
- All garminActuals km calculations now filter to run-type slots only (exclude cross/gym/strength/rest/tennis/swim/bike/etc. by workout ID keyword). Previously all activity distances were summed regardless of type.
- Retroactive `completedKm` correction in `loadState` uses the same run-only filter.
- Home dashboard stat renamed "Total Km Run" → "Km This Week" and now shows only the current week's run km (live), not a cumulative total. 11km for a week where 11km of running was logged.

### Bug fix: Past week completedKm retroactively corrected from garminActuals on load (`src/state/persistence.ts`)
- `completedKm` was stored using planned km from workout descriptions. On every `loadState`, past weeks that have `garminActuals` entries now have their `completedKm` recomputed from actual Garmin distances, so all stats (total km, bar chart, etc.) reflect what was actually run.
- "Runs rated" renamed to "Runs completed" in stats tab volume card.

### Bug fix: Stats tab volume card now shows true total km and includes current week (`src/ui/stats-view.ts`)
- "Block total" renamed to "Total km" and now includes the current week's km (past `completedKm` + current `garminActuals` sum).
- Bar chart extended to include the current week as a brighter bar.

### Bug fix: Total km stat now uses actual Garmin distance instead of planned (`src/ui/events.ts`, `src/ui/renderer.ts`, `src/ui/main-view.ts`)
- All three km-summing code paths were parsing planned distance from `wo.d` (e.g. "10km"). Now each checks `wk.garminActuals[wId].distanceKm` first and only falls back to the description if no Garmin actual exists.
- `events.ts`: `wk.completedKm` stored on week advance now uses actual distance — this fixes stats-view and all past-week totals.
- `renderer.ts`: current-week live `stat-km` element also uses actuals.
- `main-view.ts`: `_computeTotalKm` (VDOT panel "Total Distance") now uses stored `wk.completedKm` for past weeks (avoiding redundant regeneration) and checks garminActuals for the current week.

### Bug fix: HR target pill hidden for completed runs (`src/ui/renderer.ts`)
- The target HR zone pill was shown even after a run was rated/completed. Added `&& !rtd` so it only appears on planned (not-yet-done) workouts.

### Bug fix: "Start Run" button hidden for Garmin-logged runs (`src/ui/renderer.ts`)
- Garmin-completed runs had `rtd` set but no `gpsRecId`, so the GPS block showed "Start Run" instead of nothing. Fixed by adding `&& !rtd` to the `else if (!viewOnly)` guard — the button is now only shown for workouts that haven't been rated/completed yet.

---

## 2026-02-24 (Round 3)

### Apple Watch / HealthKit sync implemented (`src/data/appleHealthSync.ts`, `src/ui/wizard/steps/fitness.ts`, `src/ui/account-view.ts`, `src/main.ts`)
- Replaced the dead `capacitor-health-kit` package stub with a full implementation using `@capgo/capacitor-health` (`Health.requestAuthorization` + `Health.queryWorkouts`).
- Apple Watch workouts are converted to the same `GarminActivityRow` shape and fed into `matchAndAutoComplete()` — identical pipeline to Garmin.
- Users choose their wearable (Garmin or Apple Watch) during onboarding (fitness wizard step) and in the Account view. The choice is mutually exclusive and stored as `s.wearable: 'garmin' | 'apple'`.
- `src/main.ts` launch sync branches on `s.wearable`: Apple Watch → `syncAppleHealth()`, Garmin → existing `isGarminConnected()` path.
- Account view is now device-aware: shows an Apple Watch card (Sync Now + Switch Device) when `s.wearable === 'apple'`, otherwise the existing Garmin card.
- New state fields: `SimulatorState.wearable?: 'garmin' | 'apple'` and `OnboardingState.watchType?: 'garmin' | 'apple'`.

---

## 2026-02-24 (Round 2)

### "Reduced due to strength" modReason still appearing from excess load card path (`src/ui/excess-load-card.ts`)
- **Bug**: `triggerExcessLoadAdjustment` used `mw.modReason || \`Excess load: ${sportLabel}\`` — `applyAdjustments` always sets `mw.modReason` to `"Reduced due to ${sportName}"`, so the fallback label never fired and the wrong format was stored.
- **Fix**: Changed to always use `` `Garmin: ${sportLabel}` `` (same pattern as the activity-review.ts fix), ensuring `openActivityReReview` cleanup filter (`startsWith('Garmin:')`) works for excess-load-card-sourced mods.

### Old "Reduced due to strength / due to gym" workout mods cleaned up on load (`src/state/persistence.ts`)
- **Bug**: Mods from before the modReason prefix fix were persisted in state with the wrong format (`"Reduced due to strength"`, `"Downgraded from threshold to steady due to strength"`). These can't be cleaned up by re-review (wrong prefix) and corrupt the workout card display.
- **Fix**: Added a one-time cleanup block in `loadState` that removes any `WorkoutMod` whose `modReason` contains `"due to strength"` or `"due to gym"`. Saves to localStorage only if something changed.

### Previous week's unresolved excess load carries over to current week (`src/state/persistence.ts`)
- **Bug**: `unspentLoadItems` is per-week. If the user advanced from week N to N+1 without dismissing/adjusting excess load, those items were invisible on the current-week Training tab (excess load card only renders `s.wks[s.w - 1]`).
- **Fix**: Added carry-over block in `loadState`: if `wks[w-2].unspentLoadItems` has items not already in `wks[w-1].unspentLoadItems` (checked by `garminId`), they're moved into the current week and cleared from the previous week. Idempotent — safe to run on every load.

### Sync Garmin guard now unblocks when suggestion modal is orphaned (`src/data/activitySync.ts`)
- **Bug**: The `_pendingModalActive` reset in `syncActivities` only checked for `activity-review-overlay` absence. If `suggestion-modal` was somehow orphaned (e.g. native iOS back gesture), the flag would remain stuck and future syncs silently returned early.
- **Fix**: Extended the check to `!document.getElementById('activity-review-overlay') && !document.getElementById('suggestion-modal')` — resets the flag only when neither modal is open.

---

## 2026-02-24

### "Reduced due to strength" modReason no longer appears on random workouts (`src/ui/activity-review.ts`)
- **Bug**: When all overflow cross-training items had `appType === 'other'`, the fallback `?? 'gym'` caused `normalizeSport('gym')` = `'strength'`, so `applyAdjustments` set `modReason = "Reduced due to strength"` on random workouts with no strength workout in the log. Additionally, `mw.modReason || \`Garmin: ${sportLabel}\`` always resolved to `mw.modReason` (since `applyAdjustments` always sets it), so the `"Garmin:"` prefix never made it into the stored mod — meaning the cleanup filter in `openActivityReReview` (which uses `startsWith('Garmin:')`) could never find and remove these mods.
- **Fix**: Changed fallback from `?? 'gym'` to `?? 'other'` in `applyReview`. Changed `modReason` in both `applyReview` and `autoProcessActivities` to always use `` `Garmin: ${sportLabel}` `` (dropped the `mw.modReason ||` prefix) so the cleanup filter works correctly.

### Today's workout not appearing after "Sync Garmin" when modal was previously cancelled (`src/data/activitySync.ts`)
- **Bug**: If the user cancelled the activity review modal earlier in the same session, `_pendingModalActive` was stuck at `true`. Subsequent calls to `processPendingCrossTraining()` — including via "Sync Garmin" — returned immediately at the guard, so newly synced activities were never surfaced. (Module-level JS state persists for the full app session on iOS Capacitor; only force-quit resets it.)
- **Fix**: In `syncActivities()`, before calling `processPendingCrossTraining()`, reset `_pendingModalActive = false` if `document.getElementById('activity-review-overlay')` is absent. Safe guard: if a review is already open the overlay exists and we don't reset.

---

## 2026-02-23 (Activity Matching UX Fixes)

### Matching screen: overflow items start in tray, not Excess Load bucket; excess load now correct; re-review choices preserved (`src/ui/matching-screen.ts`, `src/ui/activity-review.ts`)
- **Bug 1 (UX)**: No message telling the user that matches were pre-populated. Fixed: added "Suggested matches applied — move anything around if needed" subtitle to header.
- **Bug 2 (overflow placement)**: Unmatched activities were pre-assigned to the Excess Load bucket in the matching screen rather than sitting in the tray for the user to manually place. Fixed: overflow items now initialise as `null` (tray). The unassigned hint explains "confirm to send to Excess Load".
- **Bug 3 (no excess load after confirm)**: Tray-leftover items (null assignment) were not fed into `reductionItems` on confirm, so `populateUnspentLoadItems` was called with an empty list and `wk.unspentLoadItems` stayed empty. Fixed: `handleConfirm` now treats `val === null` identically to `val === 'reduction'` — both route to excess load.
- **Bug 4 (re-review auto log-only)**: After confirming, `applyReview` saved `updatedChoices` (which had reduction items changed to 'log') into `garminReviewChoices`. On re-review those items appeared as 'log only'. Fixed: the matching-screen confirm callback now saves the original `choices` to `garminReviewChoices` first; `applyReview` skips overwriting `garminReviewChoices` when `confirmedMatchings` is provided.
- **Cosmetic**: Confirm button is always green — unassigned items are valid (they become excess load), so grey/disabled styling was misleading.

### Cancel on activity review no longer blocks future syncs (`src/ui/activity-review.ts`)
- **Bug**: Pressing Cancel on either the intro screen or review screen left `_pendingModalActive = true` permanently (for the session). All subsequent calls to `processPendingCrossTraining()` — including via the "Sync Garmin" button — returned immediately at the guard check, so activities could never be reviewed again without force-quitting the app.
- **Fix**: Both cancel handlers (`#ar-cancel-intro` and `#ar-cancel`) now call `onComplete()` instead of `render()` directly. Since `onComplete` from `processPendingCrossTraining` resets the flag and calls `render()`, behaviour is identical except the guard is correctly released. Activities remain in `wk.garminPending` as `'__pending__'` so they re-appear on the next sync.



### Gym overflow no longer triggers run-reduction modal (`src/ui/activity-review.ts`)
- **Bug**: When HIIT/gym activities couldn't find a planned gym slot, they fell into `gymOverflow` → `remainingCross`, which went through `buildCrossTrainingPopup` and suggested reducing running sessions "due to strength" (because `normalizeSport('gym')` = `'strength'`). This is semantically wrong — gym sessions don't substitute for aerobic running load.
- **Fix**: In both `applyReview` and `autoProcessActivities`, gym overflow is now handled separately: each item is logged as an adhoc workout without triggering the cross-training load modal. Only true cross-training overflow (sports, rides, etc.) triggers plan reduction suggestions.

### Matched gym/cross slots now show activity name (`src/ui/activity-review.ts`, `src/ui/renderer.ts`, `src/types/state.ts`)
- **Bug**: When a planned "Gym" or "Cross Training" slot was matched to a Garmin activity (e.g. HIIT, Tennis), the slot card just showed "Done" and a duplicate adhoc card ("HIIT (Garmin)") appeared alongside it.
- **Fix**: Slot matches for gym and cross now store `garminActuals` with a `displayName` field (like run slots already did), without creating a duplicate adhoc card. In the renderer: calendar cards show "→ Tennis" / "→ HIIT" status labels, gym detail cards show the activity name + duration/HR, cross detail cards show a "Matched: Tennis" orange banner. Added `displayName?: string` to `GarminActual` type.
- Also improved garmin ID detection in renderer to use `garminActuals.garminId` for all slot types (not just workoutMod-based detection).

### Tap occupied matching screen slot → return to tray (`src/ui/matching-screen.ts`)
- **Fix**: Tapping an occupied slot card with no activity selected now deassigns that activity back to the tray. Previously it did nothing (`return` early). Added "Tap to return to tray" hint on occupied slots when nothing is selected.

---

## 2026-02-23 (Matching Week Boundary Fixes — Round 3)

### Smarter planStartDate derivation + garmin data reset (`src/state/persistence.ts`)
- Old formula `today − (w−1)×7` assumed today is the *first* day of week `w`. But when the user completes week `w` on its final day (e.g., Monday is day 1 of the next real calendar week), the formula is off by 7 days. This caused week boundaries to be wrong by an entire week.
- New `derivePlanStartDate()`: scans all weeks' `garminPending` and adhoc workout timestamps to find the earliest recorded Garmin activity, then anchors: `planStartDate = Monday(earliestActivity) − (w−1) × 7`. Falls back to Monday of today if no activity timestamps exist.
- New `clearGarminData()`: when `planStartDate` is first derived (was missing), clears all garmin matching data across every week (`garminMatched`, `garminActuals`, `garminPending`, `garminReviewChoices`, `unspentLoadItems`, garmin adhoc workouts, and Garmin-auto-completed RPE ratings). The next sync redistributes everything to the correct weeks via the week-aware matching code.

## 2026-02-23 (Matching Week Boundary Fixes — Round 2)

### Week-aware date label in navigator (`src/ui/main-view.ts`)
- The `<p>` showing the date range ("Mon 17 Feb – Sun 23 Feb") had no DOM ID. `updateViewWeek` couldn't update it, so the date stayed frozen at the initial render's week.
- Added `id="week-date-label"` to the element and wired `updateViewWeek` to update it via `getWeekDateLabel(s, viewWeek)` on every navigation step.

### Week-aware activity matching rebuilt (`src/calculations/activity-matcher.ts`)
- `matchAndAutoComplete` always wrote to `wks[s.w - 1]` (current week) and used a single date window. With the "last 7 days" fallback (when `planStartDate` was missing), all recent activities landed in the current week regardless of which plan week they actually belonged to.
- Rebuilt: activities are now grouped by their correct plan week using `weekIndexForDate()` (derived from `planStartDate`), then processed against that week's data.
- `regenerateWeekWorkouts` now takes an explicit `weekIdx` parameter (instead of using `s.w`) so VDOT, skips, and trailing effort are correct for the target week.
- Past-week cross-training: logged as adhoc directly in that week (no modal — the week is done).
- Past-week unmatched runs: logged as adhoc in that week.
- Current-week cross-training / low-confidence runs: still queued for user review via Activity Review (unchanged).

## 2026-02-23 (Matching Week Boundary Fixes)

### `planStartDate` never derived for existing v2 users (`src/state/persistence.ts`)
- The derivation of `planStartDate` was inside `migrateState()` but below the early-return for users already on schema v2. As a result, any user who had been on schema v2 before `planStartDate` was added never got it set, causing week dates to not show in the UI and the date-range filter to fall back to "last 7 days".
- Fixed by moving the derivation into `loadState()` as an always-run block (independent of schema version). Saves the derived date back to localStorage immediately.

### Cross-week activity re-matching (`src/calculations/activity-matcher.ts`)
- `matchAndAutoComplete` only checked the current week's `wk.garminMatched` when de-duplicating incoming rows. After advancing a week, activities already matched in previous weeks were invisible to this check, re-appeared as "new", and could be re-queued for the current week if their date fell within the new week's window.
- Fixed by building a global set of all garmin IDs processed in any week across `s.wks` before filtering. Any ID present in any week's `garminMatched` is excluded.

## 2026-02-23 (Activity Review UX Polish — Round 2)

### Matching Screen — bucket contents visible + removable (`src/ui/matching-screen.ts`)
- Items in the **Excess Load** and **Log Only** buckets now shown as chips inside their bucket.
- Tapping a chip (× button) returns that activity to the tray (unassigned); re-select and re-assign to a slot.
- Original review-screen "Log Only" items shown as non-removable static chips (no ×); manually-sent items have ×.
- Bucket click handler guards against chip taps (stopPropagation → chip click handled separately).
- Log-only (review-screen `choices === 'log'`) items removed from the tray entirely — they're already in the log-only bucket.
- Tray section renamed "Select Activity"; shows "X in slots ✓" count.
- Added `weekLabel?: string` param to `showMatchingScreen`; shown in header under "Assign Activities".

### Week/Date Header everywhere
- **Activity Review header** (`src/ui/activity-review.ts`): shows "Week 4 of 10 · Mon 17 – Sun 23 Feb" below the title.
- **Matching Screen header**: shows same label (computed + passed from activity-review.ts).
- Computed from `planStartDate + (w-1)*7`.

### Garmin Activities Filtered to Current Week (`src/data/activitySync.ts`)
- `processPendingCrossTraining` now computes current week date range from `planStartDate` and filters `unprocessed` to only items within that range. Prevents activities from previous weeks appearing in the review.

### Excess Load Card Always Visible (`src/ui/excess-load-card.ts`)
- When `unspentLoadItems` is empty, renders a subtle grey empty-state card ("No overflow — all activities matched to plan slots") so the section is always visible and the user can confirm the feature is wired correctly.

---

## 2026-02-23 (Activity Review UX Polish)

### Choice Persistence (`src/ui/activity-review.ts`)
- Integrate/Log choices now persist on refresh: `showActivityReview` falls back to `wk.garminReviewChoices` when no explicit `savedChoices` provided.
- Toggle changes are saved to `wk.garminReviewChoices` + `saveState()` immediately, not just on Apply.

### Matching Screen Improvements (`src/ui/matching-screen.ts`)
- Slot cards now ordered by day of week (Mon→Sun).
- Slot cards show actual calendar dates ("Mon 23 Feb") when `weekStartDate` is available; `activity-review.ts` computes and passes this from `planStartDate + (w-1)*7`.
- Activity tray sorted by type: runs first → gym → cross/other, then chronologically.
- Assigned activities disappear from tray to save space; re-tapping an occupied slot bumps the old activity back to the tray.
- Tray shows "X assigned ✓" count header; shows "All activities assigned ✓" when tray is empty.
- Activity cards show actual date ("Mon 23 Feb") from `item.startTime`.
- `showMatchingScreen` signature gains optional `weekStartDate?: Date` param (non-breaking).

### Toast Animation (`tailwind.config.js`)
- Added `fade-in` keyframe and `animate-fade-in` animation so toast slides in from below.

---

## 2026-02-23 (Activity Matching UX Redesign)

### UnspentLoadItem Type (`src/types/state.ts`)
- Added `UnspentLoadItem` interface: `garminId`, `displayName`, `sport`, `durationMin`, `aerobic`, `anaerobic`, `date`, `reason`.
- Added `unspentLoadItems?: UnspentLoadItem[]` to `Week` interface alongside existing `unspentLoad: number`.

### Assignment Toast (`src/ui/toast.ts` — NEW)
- `showAssignmentToast(lines)` renders a floating dark card above the tab bar with one line per assignment.
- Lines format: `"Activity → Workout Day"`, `"Activity → Excess load"`, `"Activity → Logged (no plan impact)"`.
- Auto-dismisses after 5s; tap anywhere on toast to dismiss early. Replaces any existing toast.

### Excess Load Card (`src/ui/excess-load-card.ts` — NEW)
- `renderExcessLoadCard(wk)` returns empty string if no `unspentLoadItems`; otherwise renders a persistent amber card on the Training tab.
- Shows aerobic + anaerobic mini-bars, [Adjust Plan] and [Dismiss] (two-tap) buttons.
- Tapping card body opens `showExcessLoadPopup()` listing each UnspentLoadItem with mini-bars.
- `triggerExcessLoadAdjustment()` builds a combined activity from all items, calls existing `buildCrossTrainingPopup()` + `showSuggestionModal()` flow, then clears items on decision.
- Wired into `main-view.ts` via `renderExcessLoadCard()` + `wireExcessLoadCard()`.

### Matching Screen (`src/ui/matching-screen.ts` — NEW)
- `showMatchingScreen(overlay, pending, choices, pairings, allWorkouts, onConfirm, onBack)` replaces the dropdown-based `showMatchingConfirmation()`.
- Horizontal scrollable slot cards (week workout slots) + horizontal activity tray + Reduction and Log-only buckets.
- Tap activity to select (blue highlight), tap slot to assign (compatibility check), tap bucket to send there.
- Pre-populated from `proposeMatchings()` — overflow items start in Reduction bucket.
- Compatible types enforced: run→run slots, gym→gym slots, cross→cross slots; incompatible taps ignored.
- Confirm callback returns `(confirmedMatchings, reductionItems, logonlyItems)`.

### Activity Review Redesign (`src/ui/activity-review.ts`)
- `showReviewScreen()` ar-apply handler now routes ≥2 integrate items to `showMatchingScreen()` instead of `showMatchingConfirmation()`.
- `populateUnspentLoadItems()`: adds reduction-bucket items to `wk.unspentLoadItems`.
- `buildAssignmentLines()`: builds toast-ready strings for all pending items.
- `autoProcessActivities()`: now calls `showAssignmentToast()` after all assignments; overflow items get added to `unspentLoadItems` before showing suggestion modal; on modal dismiss, unspentLoadItems remain (excess load card fallback); on modal confirm, clears overflow items from unspentLoadItems.
- Removed local `ProposedPairing` interface (moved to `matching-screen.ts` as shared type).

## 2026-02-23

### Plan Start Date & Week Date Range (`renderer.ts`, `state/`)
- Added `planStartDate` to state, set on first render if absent.
- Week header now shows the actual Mon–Sun date range (e.g. "17–23 Feb") derived from `planStartDate + (w-1)*7`.
- Calendar columns labelled Mon/Tue/.../Sun instead of generic day numbers.

### Auto-Process Single Garmin Activities (`ui/activity-review.ts`, `data/activitySync.ts`)
- When exactly one activity is pending and the match confidence is high, the review screen is bypassed and the activity is applied automatically with a brief toast notification.
- Multi-activity batches still go through the full review flow.

### Matching Confirmation Screen (`ui/activity-review.ts`)
- For batches of ≥2 "integrate" activities, a new intermediate screen appears between the integrate/log choices and `applyReview`.
- Each activity is shown with a dropdown pre-populated with the algorithm's proposed workout pairing.
- First dropdown option is always "⚠ No slot — load adjustment modal" (overflow).
- Users can reassign any pairing before confirming.
- "← Back" re-renders the review screen in-place (overlay reuse, no layout shift).
- On confirm, `applyReview` receives a `confirmedMatchings: Map<string, string | null>` that overrides all auto-matching; the day-proximity generic cross-slot heuristic is skipped when this map is present.
- New helpers: `proposeMatchings()` (dry-run of matching logic), `activityEmoji()`, `workoutTypeShort()`.

### Runner-Type Proportional Load Reduction (`cross-training/suggester.ts`, `ui/events.ts`, `ui/activity-review.ts`)
- Added optional `runnerType?: 'Speed' | 'Endurance' | 'Balanced'` to `AthleteContext`.
- Speed runners: `buildReduceAdjustments` sorts candidates volume-first (easy runs cut before quality downgrades).
- Endurance/Balanced: existing intensity-first behaviour preserved.
- Both `events.ts` call sites and the `activity-review.ts` ctx construction pass `s.typ`.

### Workout Card Labels + Undo Button (`ui/renderer.ts`)
- Detail card banner: "RUN REPLACED" → "Replaced by HIIT" / "Reduced — Tennis (45min)". Strips "Garmin: " prefix from `modReason` before display.
- Calendar compact status label: "Replaced" → "→ HIIT".
- Calendar cyan sub-line: shows activity name without prefix.
- Undo button in the banner calls `window.openActivityReReview()` to reopen the review modal.
- New test file `src/ui/renderer-labels.test.ts` (19 tests) covering all three label helpers — all passing.

### Welcome Back / Missed Week Detection (`ui/welcome-back.ts`, `main.ts`)
- `detectMissedWeeks()`: computes number of full weeks elapsed since the plan's current week end date.
- `showWelcomeBackModal(weeksGap, onComplete)`: modal shown once per calendar day (guarded via localStorage) when the user returns after ≥1 missed week.
- Applies VDOT detraining: ~1.2%/week for weeks 1–2, ~0.8%/week thereafter (diminishing compound).
- 3+ week gaps: sets training phase to `'base'`.
- Experience-level awareness: shows fitness-data-focused messaging for competitive/elite/hybrid/returning users.
- Wired into `launchApp()` in `main.ts`; fires before `renderMainView()`.

### Load Modal Improvements (`ui/suggestion-modal.ts`)
- Runner type context line: "Speed runner · Volume cuts prioritised — quality sessions protected".
- Equivalent easy km badge: "≈ 8.4 km easy running equivalent".
- Improved downgrade detail text: "Keep 8km — drop to steady pace (MP–easy midpoint)".
- Warnings rendered in amber (`text-amber-500`).

## 2026-02-12

### Phase Transition Fixes (`engine.ts`)
- **Acute phase gate**: Was using a 72-hour real-time gate (`ACUTE_PHASE_MIN_HOURS`). In the simulator users click through weeks so 72 hours never passes. Fixed: `canProgressFromAcute()` now also accepts `state.history.length >= 2` (one weekly check-in after initial report).
- **Pain regression**: Added general regression at the top of `evaluatePhaseTransition()`. Pain ≥ 7 in any non-acute phase → back to acute. Pain ≥ 4 in test_capacity / return_to_run / graduated_return → regress one phase via `applyPhaseRegression()`.

### Graduated Return Workout Descriptions (`engine.ts`, `intent_to_workout.ts`, `renderer.ts`)
- Rewrote graduated return downgrade in `applyInjuryAdaptations()` to handle multi-line descriptions correctly.
- `extractLines()` splits on `\n`, separates WU/CD from main set. `stripMainSet()` strips both zone-labeled and bare paces.
- Marathon Pace and progressive workouts now downgrade to "steady" pace (halfway between easy and threshold), not "easy".
- Distances rounded to nearest 10m (`fmtDist()`: `Math.round(km * 100) * 10`).
- Long Run (Fast Finish) → "Steady Run". Marathon Pace → "Steady Pace".

### Complete Rest UI Scoping (`renderer.ts`)
- `w.t === 'rest'` check was too broad — suppressed rating UI for ALL rest workouts. Added `isCompleteRest` flag that only matches workouts containing "RICE", "No physical activity", or "Complete rest" in their description.

### Cross-Training Suggester for Downgraded Workouts (`generator.ts`, `suggester.ts`)
- **Stale loads**: `generateWeekWorkouts()` calculated loads before `applyInjuryAdaptations()`. Fixed by adding a load recalculation loop after injury adaptations.
- **Invisible workouts**: `buildCandidates()` was filtering out `status: 'reduced'` workouts. Added `alreadyDowngraded` field to `PlannedRun`. Reduced workouts now appear with a -0.50 similarity penalty.
- Excluded `return_run`, `capacity_test`, and `gym` from cross-training candidate pool.

## 2026-02-11

### Workout Description Overhaul (`intent_to_workout.ts`, `renderer.ts`, `parser.ts`)
- VO2/Threshold descriptions no longer show pace twice.
- New multi-line format: `1km warm up\n5×3min @ 3:47/km (~790m)\n1km cool down`.
- `wucdKm()` helper adds WU/CD if session is under 30 min.
- Calendar compact view shows main set only for VO2/Threshold.

### Load Calculator Fix (`load.ts`) — Critical
- `calculateWorkoutLoad()` was parsing `1km` from the warm-up line, giving VO2 a load of ~20 instead of ~135.
- Fixed: multi-line handler strips WU/CD lines, parses main set, adds WU/CD time at easy pace.

### Cross-Training Downgrade Structure Preservation (`suggester.ts`)
- `applyAdjustments()` now inspects the original description format. Intervals stay as intervals at lower pace; progressive runs become plain easy long runs.
- Added `paces?: Paces` parameter so actual pace values appear in descriptions.

### Replace vs Reduce — Interleaved Algorithm (`suggester.ts`)
- Replaced the old two-pass algorithm. New interleaved: replace 1 → reduce/downgrade 1 → replace 1... Naturally scales with budget.

### Easy Run Replacement Fix (`renderer.ts`)
- Apply stored mods before deduplicating names. Previously mods stored "Easy Run" but the lookup happened after rename to "Easy Run 1" etc.

### Steady Pace for Threshold Downgrades (`suggester.ts`, `suggestion-modal.ts`)
- Threshold downgrades show steady pace = `(paces.e + paces.t) / 2` rather than true marathon pace.

### Replaced Workout UX (`renderer.ts`)
- "LOAD COVERED" → "RUN REPLACED". Shows original description struck through. Forecast load hidden for replaced workouts.
